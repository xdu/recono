  "text": "The Economist December 20th 2025\n\ntold not to publish over-critical accounts of the government that they said might sow discord. The warning explicitly concerned coverage of the Tai Po fire, but correspondents drew a broader message. On December 15th the spokesperson of the Commissioner\u2019s Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong wrote to some outlets in the city \u201cto draw...attention to some facts\u201d, for example that Mr Lai\u2019s case \u201chas nothing to do with press freedom\u201d.\n\nIt is unclear what the reverberations in Hong Kong will be. Supporters of Mr Lai queued overnight to watch the verdict\u2019s delivery. A sense of resignation pervades the city. \u201cA lot of people are just saying: \u2018Oh well, [Mr Lai] he is gone,\u201d says one resident. Except for national-security cases, the territory\u2019s common-law legal system, inherited from Britain, is still generally considered fair. Business leaders have broadly kept quiet about Mr Lai\u2019s case. But aspects of his treatment have caused liberal types to raise their eyebrows.\n\nAlthough protest has become more difficult at home, Mr Lai\u2019s fortunes have attracted criticism abroad. Britain condemned Mr Lai\u2019s \u201cpolitically motivated persecution\u201d and called for his release, as did the European Union. Marco Rubio, America\u2019s secretary of state, lambasted \u201cthe enforcement of Beijing\u2019s laws to silence those who seek to protect freedom of speech\u201d. But both Sir Keir Starmer, Britain\u2019s prime minister, and Donald Trump, America\u2019s president, are planning to visit Beijing early next year. The leaders may wish to avoid provoking Xi Jinping, their Chinese counterpart, by pressing Mr Lai\u2019s case. Britain is already wrangling with China over a new embassy in London and spying scandals. And Mr Trump is keen for more dealmaking after a truce in Sino-American trade tensions was agreed in October.\n\nBesides, China does not take kindly to others meddling in its domestic matters. After the verdict China\u2019s foreign ministry warned other governments \u201cnot to interfere in Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary or China\u2019s internal affairs in any form\u201d, while the central government\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong described the outcome as a \u201cstern warning\u201d to \u201canti-China\u201d forces. It also decried \u201cthe political manipulation of Hong Kong by a small number of Western politicians and anti-China media under the guise of \u2018human rights\u2019 and \u2018freedom\u2019.\n\nAuthorities in Hong Kong will hope that the world moves on quickly from the verdict. But for some Mr Lai will remain a symbol of the city\u2019s transformation. He arrived on its shores as a 12-year-old refugee from mainland China, a penniless stowaway in a boat. His fortunes rose alongside those of Hong Kong, making him an emblem of its promise. Now he will be remembered by his supporters as a martyr to his convictions.\n\nA visit to Yiwu\n\nSnow globalisation\n\nYiwu\n\nChina 35\n\nHow Chinese traders manage to beat out Lapland\u2019s elves\n\nyou IN EASTERN China is the world\u2019s Christmas capital. The five main districts which contain its wholesale markets, each home to vast commercial buildings, stretch for miles on end. Masses of stalls are, for much of the year, dedicated to Christmas paraphernalia: trees, ornaments, hats, wreaths and candy canes. It hums in the summer months, when jolly fare is readied for elsewhere. By December each year it lies more quiet. The city\u2019s wares will have contributed to China\u2019s record $itrn trade surplus in the first 11 months of 2025.\n\nChina dominates exports of the world\u2019s Christmas decorations by value; in the recent past America has bought more than half of what China produced. But this year in the ten months to October China exported $5.1bn of the trinkets, down from $5.8bn over the same period in 2024. America has been responsible for all of that decline and more, having imported about $940m less in festive fare from China than it did last year. That is thanks to President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and his introduction of painful tariffs, which though down from their peak still stand at 20% for Chinese goods.\n\nThe large number of banners, signs and decorations saying \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d and \u201cBuon Natale\u201d suggests that many merchants are shifting to other markets in response. Data show exports to Germany and the Netherlands are up by 22% and 16%, respectively. And there are\n\nmore grinchy ways of getting around the American tariffs, too. Dismembering Father Christmas and then shipping his head, limbs and torso to South-East Asia is one such ruse. Reassembling him, relabelling him and selling him on to America thereafter is more jolly.\n\nYiwu\u2019s traders are a worldly sort, and not all about Christmas. They converse with visiting buyers from India, the Middle East and Russia. Arabic, Spanish and other tongues can be heard among its stalls. The criticism of Mr Trump in many languages is stinging. \u201cAmerica is crazy these days,\u201d gripes Yang Jie, a local. \u201cWe can\u2019t do business with them, it\u2019s just impossible to plan,\u201d she adds. \u201cHow can I set prices when I don\u2019t know what the tariff will be when I ship?\u201d asks a vendor in a stall blooming with artificial flowers.\n\nMr Trump is not the only problem. \u201cThe war in Ukraine has really been a headache for us,\u201d says Wu Yunqing, a car-parts seller. Demand has dropped in Russia, and he has lost touch with customers in Ukraine. A woman selling shirts does business across the Middle East. The flare-up between Israel and Iran made her very nervous, she says.\n\nYet the mood still twinkles. Many have their eyes on the next round of orders. The city\u2019s merchants make decorations for festivals Christian, Muslim and more. Ms Jie has just finished sending the last few shipments of decorations for Ramadan in February. What next? Chinese New Year, of course. "
