  "text": "18 Holiday specials\n\nAre you using a phone, like most punters? Good. Ora computer, which makes it easier to compare odds? Not so good. Did you deposit by debit card, or via the ewallets preferred by syndicates? Are you a woman? That is suspicious. Far fewer women bet than men, and many sharps get women to place bets for them.\n\nThe first wager you place speaks volumes. Normal punters bet on the most popular spectacles, such as English Premier League football or America\u2019s National Football League (NFL), starting around half an hour before kickoff. They generally bet on who will win, what the scoring margin will be and which statistical milestone a star player will achieve, paying little attention to the odds. Square players love to combine multiple bets into a \u201cparlay\u201d or \u201caccumulator\u201d, which delivers a big payout only if all of them win.\n\nSharps have the opposite tendencies. They target less popular leagues and bet as soon as odds are published, when they are most likely to be mispriced. They shop around. They like obscure \u201cderivative\u201d markets, such as how many points will be scored in the third quarter, and bets on lesser-known players to perform poorly. They rarely use parlays. They make big deposits, and seldom withdraw winnings. \u201cBy the time a customer places his first bet, [sportsbooks] are 80-90% certain they know the lifetime value of the account,\u201d says Ed Birkin of H2, a gambling consultancy.\n\nIf that bet happens to snipe an outdated or off-market price, says Phillip Gray, a former head trader at Sports Interaction, a betting firm in Canada, the player will usually be limited on the spot. Otherwise, it takes only a few more wagers to identify a sharp. Sportsbooks look at a player\u2019s \u201cclosing-line value\u2019\u2014a measure that compares the odds at which he bets with those available right before a match begins. If it is consistently ahead of the market over his first ten wagers, he is highly likely to beat the book in the long run.\n\nSurveillance never lets up. An internal document summarising the \u201cscorecard\u201d system used a few years ago by GVC, a big firm now called Entain, tells traders to monitor mathematically modelled \u201crisk scores\u201d\u2014an estimate of the probability that customers will wind up unprofitable\u2014every six to eight hours. It highlights e-wallet users, women and bets over \u20ac100 ($115) for scrutiny. Suspected sharps are allowed a 30% stake factor; confirmed undesirables are restricted to 1%.\n\nEven after learning all this, your correspondent still couldn\u2019t work out how so many betting sites caught on to him so quickly. So he went to Dublin to find out.\n\nOn the ground floor of a grand red-brick building is the single-room office of AK Bets, a sportsbook with roughly 50,000 accounts whose website launched in 2023. Anthony Kaminskas, the site\u2019s owner, said that in the previous week it had kicked out 13 users. One had identified a football league for which data feeds tend to be slow. As soon as a goal was scored, the customer tried to bet \u00a3400 before AK\u2019s odds caught up. Other accounts were banned for consistently targeting obscure events, like the number of perfect scores in darts tournaments, at odds far superior to the closing price. In contrast, a golf bettor with \u00a323,000 in profits on \u00a325,000 of wagers remains in good standing. \u201cHe\u2019s betting into prices we\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d Mr Kaminskas says. \u201cIf he wins, he wins.\u201d\n\nYour correspondent\u2019s first wager with AK was, apparently, too clever by half. \u201cI recall the bet straight\n\nThe Economist December 20th 2025\n\naway,\u201d says Mr Kaminskas. It was a \u00a325 basketball bet whose result would take five months to determine. With normal customers focused on that day\u2019s football, such a wager is \u201can incredibly rare sight on a bet monitor\u201d. He factored yours truly down to 30% on the spot, appending a note saying that this punter had found a price where he had an edge over the house. The next account note was more than a year later, when your correspondent wanted \u00a3165 on the Los Angeles Rams, and AK\u2019s odds were the best in the market. Suspicions confirmed, the firm slashed his stake factor to 1%.\n\nLUCK, BEARDS AND LADIES TONIGHT\n\n\u201cRrrrrrotate!\u201d It\u2019s a sweltering day in Las Vegas, and hundreds of bleary-eyed men scramble to get up from their chairs and find their next appointment. BetBash, a conference for sports bettors, features a \u201cspeed-networking\u201d session in a windowless ballroom. Sharps with the maths skills to spot good bets are seeking partners with the social skills to get the money down.\n\nOnce you have been limited at every betting outlet, all other options have drawbacks. Betting shops and casinos accept modest cash wagers anonymously. But it is a hassle to keep mixing up hats, sunglasses and other disguises to avoid detection. Furthermore, gambling firms sometimes refuse to pay players who buy small tickets in bulk. Last year Caesars voided $800,000 in winnings by Thomas McPeek, a shaggymaned 24-year-old punter, for placing repeated bets on the same parlay at its wagering machines.\n\nA handful of \u201csharp books\u201d offer the same limits to all customers. However, these sites are not available in Britain or most American states, and because they draw a lot of well-informed wagers, their odds are hard to beat. Similarly, peer-to-peer betting exchanges often charge high fees. And anyone offering a large wager on an exchange probably knows more than you do.\n\nThe remaining venues are offshore. Websites in lightly regulated jurisdictions such as Costa Rica welcome cryptocurrency deposits and are not obliged to vet users for problem gambling or the source of their funds. But the easier it is to get your money in, the harder it can be to get it out. SingBet, a huge Asian bookmaker, routinely cancels wagers after matches finish, citing unspecified \u201cabnormal\u201d betting patterns. Less reputable sites may spuriously accuse you of cheating and take your money.\n\nAn alternative is to get someone else, known as a \u201cbeard\u201d or \u201cmule\u201d, to bet on your behalf. Such \u201cproxy betting\u201d is a violation of every sportsbook\u2019s terms, and if they catch you doing it, they will void any winnings. Moreover, according to Elihu Feustel, a gambling lawyer, if the punter executes bets in a mule account himself, it is arguably fraud. Nonetheless, it is widespread.\n\nThe safest beards are close friends and relatives, who can be trusted to pay out winnings. With appropriate operational security\u2014never logging into different accounts from the same device or wireless network; never having multiple users place the same bet; and maintaining a distinct set of physical locations for each user\u2014such artisanal bearding is almost impossible to detect. One BetBash attendee says he owns around 20 iPads, each with its own data plan, and routinely drives around his state so that each wager comes from an appropriate address.\n\nAre you a woman? That is suspicious\n\nad "
