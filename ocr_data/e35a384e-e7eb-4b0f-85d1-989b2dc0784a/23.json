In 2022 Kroger announced that it would buy Albertsons, a rival grocer, for nearly $25bn. Then things went off the rails. The attorneys-general (AGs) for Washington and Colorado challenged the merger in their respective state courts, on the grounds that the impact on prices and labour would harm their constituents. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought its own suit in federal court soon after, and the avalanche of litigation torpedoed the deal. States may have been aligned with the FTC against the merger, but they didn\u2019t wait for the feds to act before jumping into the fray. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we are willing and able to litigate cases on our own,\u201d says Phil Weiser, Colorado\u2019s attorney-general.\n\nHollywood ought to pay attention. The industry\u2019s latest merger risks becoming a sequel. Netflix and Paramount are in a\n\nheated competition to buy Warner Bros Discovery, one of Hollywood\u2019s crown jewels. David Ellison, the nepo-baby boss of Paramount, wants to purchase the studio so badly he is mounting a $108bn hostile takeover bid. On December 17th the board of Warner Bros urged shareholders to reject Paramount\u2019s offer, though Mr Ellison looks unlikely to back down so easily.

It doesn\u2019t hurt that the Ellison family is friendly with Mr Trump, a transactional president with a history of meddling in media mergers. The president has already mused about the deal, suggesting that he will ultimately decide who wins. But Mr Ellison and Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s co-chief executive, ignore state attorneys-general at their peril. Rob Bonta, California\u2019s top prosecutor, is a particular wildcard who could kill any Warner Bros merger even if decision-makers in Washington see a deal they can accept. During the auction, a spokesperson for Mr Bonta\u2019s office said that \u201cfurther consolidation in markets that are central to American economic life...does not serve the American economy, consumers or competition well.\u201d That does not sound as if he plans to defer to Washington, DC.\n\nStates have a long history of antitrust enforcement. Twelve states actually passed their own competition laws before Congress got around to drafting the Sherman Act, the foundation of America\u2019s anti-\n\ntrust regime, in 1890.
