On weekdays fishermen haul their catch to the local market and indigenous people stream in from the rainforest to sell ground manioc and buy fuel. At the weekend, tourists from neighbouring French Guiana cross the border to buy cheap food and flirt with locals. But it is not hard to see that a transformation is afoot. Hotels are popping up along the main drag. One that is set to open next year will boast seven floors, practically a skyscraper in the impoverished region. A tiny airport on the outskirts of town has been recently renovated. The whir of helicopter blades is becoming more common.\n\nLong a backwater, Oiapoque is preparing to become a boomtown. On October 20th Ibama, Brazil\u2019s environmental regulator, gave Petrobras, the state oil firm, a licence to explore for oil 160km (100 miles)\n\noff the town\u2019s coast in a region known as the Equatorial Margin (see map on next page). More than ten years in the making, the decision comes after a mounting campaign by Brazil\u2019s president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as Lula. While Ibama dithered, ExxonMobil found 1ibn barrels of proven reserves off the coast of neighbouring Guyana, worth over half a trillion dollars. The tiny new petro-state quickly became the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy. More blockbuster discoveries followed for neighbouring Suriname. Lula fumed. \u201cAre we going to get stuck eating bread and water? No! We like bread with mortadella,\u201d he told a crowd in February. Brazil\u2019s government is betting on oil\n\n> ALSOIN THIS SECTION\n\n30 Milei moves on the peso\n\nfrom the Equatorial Margin to revive the country\u2019s depleting reserves. In 2006, during Lula\u2019s first term, vast reserves were found beneath a thick layer of salt under the seabed off Rio de Janeiro. Lula triumphantly declared that the discoveries were tantamount to Brazil\u2019s second independence. The reserves, which are still being extracted, rocketed the country up the oilproducers\u2019 league table. By 2030 Brazil\u2019s \u201cpre-salt\u201d fields will make it the world\u2019s fourth-largest oil producer. But soon after that the stuff will begin to run out. Without new discoveries to keep exports going, Brazil could once again become an oil importer from 2040. Lula\u2019s government reckons this oil-export decline would mean the state missing out on trillions of reais of revenue (hundreds of billions of dollars).\n\nIn order to put off this problem, Lula has been willing to disappoint those of his fans who voted him back into power in 2023 on a green platform. The potential gains are simply too juicy. Brazil\u2019s national oil and gas agency reckons that the country\u2019s chunk of the Equatorial Margin holds over 30bn barrels of oil, of which 1obn may be recoverable. Thanks in large measure to this region, South America has become the part of the world in which oil production is growing at the fastest rate. Its output is\n\nforecast to increase by a third by 2030, >\u00bb "
