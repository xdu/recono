  "text": "The Economist December 20th 2025\n\nHook a woman by bragging\n\nat her, and then not allowing her to speak\n\ntry \u201cfreely sprinkling your conversation with words of sex\u201d. A breezy but opaque piece of advice (Which words? \u201cSprinkled\u201d how?) that feels like it might lead to some awkwardness in the office. And possibly another lawsuit. Their advice is sometimes illiterate; often immoral; at times borderline illegal. Naturally, they sell in their millions.\n\nFor millions feel they need them. With good reason. In America, over a quarter of households contain only one person. In Britain, it is about the same. Singlehood is rising in most of the rich world. Some of these singletons are happy to be so; many are not. This matters: lonely people feel sadder, die younger and suffer poorer health than those in relationships. If singletons are young and male they are also likely to experience \u201cthe manosphere\u201d\u2014an online aggregation of agerieved men who talk lovingly about protein shakes and bitterly about women.\n\nSHALL I COMPARE THEE TO A SUMMER'S DAY?\n\nSingleness falls on men and women evenly. But read 2,000 years of dating advice and it seems that most of it is aimed at men. Partly this is cultural: for centuries men were more literate, so they wrote for other men. Partly, it is sensible. Women \u201care just more emotionally intelligent than men\u201d, says Dave Barry, an American humourist and the author of a \u201cComplete Guide to Guys\u201d. They do sophisticated things like washing and listening, he observes. Many men, by contrast, need \u201cpretty primitive\u201d advice.\n\nSome of this disparity is biological. A frequent bleat of the manosphere is that dating obeys an \u201c80/20 rule\u201d: 20% of the men get 80% of the women. That is nonsense. But women are sexually far pickier than men. In 1978 researchers at an American university decided to test this empirically. Young volunteers thus approached total strangers of the opposite sex and asked them, \u201cWould you go to bed with me?\u201d Their paper would go on to become famous. Partly because those lines were made into a catchy British pop song.\n\nBut mainly because its results were so stark. The vast majority of men said \u201cYes\u201d; some asked, \u201cWhy do we have to wait until tonight?\u201d; the few who refused did so regretfully. \u201cI cannot tonight,\u201d was a typical refusal, \u201cbut tomorrow would be fine.\u201d By contrast, every single woman said \u201cNo\u201d. Most were appalled. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d was a typical response. As was: \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d The conclusions are clear: pop lyrics can come from unlikely places. And men and women approach sex very differently.\n\nManuals have thus, from the Bible on (often seen as the first self-help guide) stepped in, offering advice on everything from grooming (wash, says Ovid); to table manners (men should not, says one timeless 18th-century guide, \u201cblow their Noses on their Napkins\u201d); to their choice of paramour (do not, Leviticus warns, have \u201csexual relations with your mother. She is your mother\u201d). Which is all very sensible. If not, perhaps, things you need to tell a daughter.\n\nDespite the plethora of advice, many men feel they need more. To understand how deep the need, consider the market value of the solution. In a bright, modern flat in Miami, 12 men sit on sofas. They have notebooks, and an eager air. All have come on a four-day dating \u201cBootcamp\u201d given by a dating guru who has\n\nHoliday specials 7\n\nwritten a book subtitled \u201cHOW TO GET BEAUTIFUL WOMEN INTO BED\u201d. (Subtlety, and the sparing use of the capslock key, is not this movement's strong suit.) Charging a lot is: the full course costs around $10,000.\n\nAt 12 o'clock, it begins. For men who have paid such an abnormal amount of money, the punters look fairly normal. Aged between around 20 and 60, they wear normal clothes (jeans, shirts, T-shirts), have normallooking bodies and normal professions too: scientists, tech bros, men in finance. And though one or two describe themselves as \u201clucky\u201d (Silicon-Valley speak for \u201cstinking rich\u201d), most seem normally paid, too.\n\nThe course is being run by a man who calls himself \u201cthe world\u2019s most famous dating guru & pickup artist\u201d, which may be true, and gives his name as \u201cMystery\u201d, which definitely isn\u2019t. His real name is Erik Von Markovik and he rose to fame in the 2000s, when he featured in a dating book called \u201cThe Game\u201d, by Neil Strauss, a journalist.\n\nIt had chapter titles like \u201cSTEP 5\u2014ISOLATE THE TARGET\u201d and \u201cSTEP 10\u2014BLAST LAST-MINUTE RESISTANCE\u201d. Its glossary included terms like \u201cSHB\u2014noun\u201d \u2014\u2018Super-hot babe\u201d and \u201cLSE\u2014adjective\u2014 \u201clow self-esteem\u201d; something desirable in a SHB as it makes her more likely to give in when you \u201cCAVEMAN\u201d (don\u2019t ask). It was not exactly Austen. It was a bestseller.\n\nMen heard about \u201cThe Game\u201d, thought \u201cme too\u201d and bought it. Women heard about it, thought \u201c#MeToo\u201d, and lambasted it. Pick-up is now a (slightly) chastened industry. Though not, as this course shows, wholly so. As the men take notes, Mystery expands on his technique to pick up \u201cwomen of beauty\u201d. Courting, in Mystery\u2019s telling, is less an intimate interaction than a one-man show whose tone lies somewhere between sales and comedy.\n\nA pick-up begins with A1-3, which includes \u201cTHE ATTRACTION PHASE\u201d. A good pick-up artist, explains Mystery, must have \u201copeners\u201d to start conversation and lengthier \u201cgambits\u201d to keep it going. In this phase you must show off, or as he puts it in the inevitable acronym, \u201cDHV\u201d\u2014\u201cDemonstrate higher value\u201d, by bragging about your achievements. Like a comedian, your chat should be funny: \u201cYou're going to be laughing all the way to the bedroom.\u201d Also like a comedian, you should discourage hecklers and even audience interaction. He is not \u201cinterested in them\u2019\u2014by which he means women\u2014\u201ctalking\u201d.\n\nAfter you have hooked the woman of your dreams by bragging at her, then not allowing her to speak, you must pretend to cool off: \u201cnegging\u201d. The Game\u2019s glossary defines a neg as a \u201cseemingly accidental insult delivered to a beautiful woman\u201d to show \u201ca lack of interest in her\u201d. Mystery has published a book of negs. They include\u2014women, still your hearts\u2014\u201cYou talk a lot\u201d and \u201cEw, your palms are sweaty.\u201d\n\nAfter you\u2019ve bored your potential paramour, then insulted her, you can bounce through stages C1-3: which takes in the \u201cCOMFORT PHASE\u201d (don\u2019t leap on her instantly) before reaching the \u201cS\u201d levels: \u201cTHE SEDUCTION PHASE\u201d. By this point your SHB with LSE will be so turned on that you won't need to seduce her: she will seduce you. \u201cI\u2019m not a seducer,\u201d says Mystery, who practises what he preaches, peppering his conversation with DHVs. \u201cI\u2019m an attractor.\u201d\n\nThe whole process is intensely formulaic. Pick-up\n\nteachers call themselves \u201cartists\u201d but these numbered >> "
