A constant in dating advice is men\u2019s terror of talking to women. As that 12th-century manual noted, there are men who \u201cin the presence of ladies\u201d are so flustered that they \u201close their power of speech\u201d.\n\nThey still do, says James Bloodworth, the author of \u201cLost Boys\u201d, a book on the manosphere. He worked on a similar pick-up course and said that you couldn\u2019t tell merely by looking why the men had come; it was more \u201cwhen they opened their mouth\u201d. He saw 30-year-old virgins for whom even talking to women was \u201cterrifying\u201d, like \u201cclimbing Everest\u201d.\n\nThis awkwardness, judging by the men on the Miami course, seems typical. Several talk of feeling fearful around women. Several of those your correspondent spoke to talked too much; listened too little; walked through doors first and didn\u2019t offer women seats. Most lacked that elusive elixir: charm.\n\nIt is not clear whether this course will help them. In a break, Mystery\u2019s assistants demonstrate some of their best lines on your correspondent. She does not fall in love but is tempted to laugh, as they are terrible. Such a reaction is, says the glossary, a \u201cBITCH SHIELD\u2014noun: a woman\u2019s defensive response to deter unknown men who approach her.\u201d Or as women call it: \u201cA WHOLLY REASONABLE REACTION\u2014adv-adj-noun\u2019.\n\nPick-up pays little respect to feminism. \u201cMisogyny is baked into it,\u201d says Mr Bloodworth. But then pick-up is not pretending to be a moral guide; it is a service. And though its prose may not be Austenian, its principles are: few knew better than Austen and her \u00a310,000a-year heroes the importance of DHV-ing; few have ever negged better than Mr Darcy when he muttered that Elizabeth was \u201ctolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me\u201d.\n\nThe Economist December 20th 2025\n\nA better question is not: is it morally good; it is: does it work? And here, both detractors and supporters would agree: yes. Partly, says Mr Bloodworth, because dating is \u201ca numbers game\u201d. Just as Mrs Bennet forced her daughters out to attend balls, so pick-up forces men to stop \u201cfestering at home\u201d. Each night the men on the course must dress up, go out and speak to six to 12 groups of women. Inevitably, says Mr Bloodworth, \u201cYour social skills will improve.\u201d And, he adds, if you have halitosis \u201cSomeone is going to tell you.\u201d\n\n..~OR WOULD I GET BETTER RESULTS BY NEGGING?\n\nGoing on a pick-up course may well, then, result in better breath. Whether it will result in good relationships is less clear. But dating advice is changing. People are turning from pick-up artists to another type of expert in the mysteries of what women might want: these experts are called \u201cwomen\u201d.\n\nPick-up offers a one-size fits all approach, but as Minnie Lane, a dating and attraction coach in London, points out, women are not a category, \u201ca singular thing\u201d, but individuals. Men should thus listen to the woman in front of them as she \u201cis telling them constantly\u201d what she wants\u2014not just with words, but with her body. Ms Lane leans closer to your correspondent to prove the point and there is, indeed, an immediate charge in the air.\n\nSo for readers wanting some good dating advice, it is simple: do leave your house and your screen. Do put on a shirt. Don\u2019t spew out pre-prepared pick-up lines. Do react to the woman\u2019s responses. As indeed Ovid said, all those years ago. Look intently at the woman before you, he wrote, for \u201csilent features often have both words and expression.\u201d Although, being Ovid, he then tells his reader to kiss her anyway, whether she wants it or not. So maybe don\u2019t listen to that one. @\n\nSubtlety is not this movement's forte. Charging a lot is "
