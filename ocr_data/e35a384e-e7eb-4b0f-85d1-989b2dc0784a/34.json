On December i5th three national-security judges found Hong Kong\u2019s most famous media mogul guilty of collusion with foreign forces and of sedition. He spent 156 days on trial\u201452 of them on the witness stand. He has been behind bars for more than 1,800 days already, serving time for unauthorised assembly and fraud. When sentenced, Mr Lai could face life imprisonment.\n\nMr Lai has a long history of support for democratic causes in China; his involvement began after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Through his outspoken\n\nnewspapers the tycoon backed the millions of Hong Kongers who marched for democracy, first in 2014 and again in 2019. Mr Lai himself took to the streets in the more peaceful protests (some other demonstrations became violent). Foremost among his publications was Apple Daily, which critics found sensationalist. It had to close down almost a year after he was arrested in 2020.\n\nFew believed he would be acquitted: national-security trials have a conviction rate of over 95% in Hong Kong (including defendants who plead guilty). Although receiving medical treatment in prison, his\n\nThe Economist December 20th 2025\n\n35 China\u2019s Christmas capital\n\n\u2014 Chaguan is away\n\nfamily fear that the 78-year-old, who suffers from diabetes, will die behind bars. Despite being a British citizen, he chose to stay put. \u201cI must face the consequences of my actions, just or unjust,\u201d he wrote from prison. \u201cIt is also a way to uphold the dignity of Hong Kong people, as one of the leaders for the fight of freedom.\u201d\n\nThe judges saw things differently. In their 855-page judgment, they claimed Mr Lai was \u201cobsessed\u201d with \u201cturning China into a lackey of the West\u201d, and had published seditious articles to \u201cundermine the legitimacy or authority\u201d of the governments in both Hong Kong and Beijing. They said he had used his \u201cpersonal influence\u201d to call for foreign countries to impose sanctions on China. Notably, they suggested he had continued his \u201cinternational lobbying\u201d by \u201cindirect and subtle means\u201d even after the introduction of a national-security law (NSL) in 2020 made it a crime. The defence had argued that Mr Lai stopped all such activities when they became illegal. (Before the NSL was promulgated he met powerful potential supporters such as Mike Pence, who was America\u2019s vice-president at the time.)\n\nIt is a febrile moment. A terrible fire last month in the Tai Po neighbourhood consumed seven apartment blocks, killing at least 160 people. A recent election saw the second-lowest turnout on record, and was taken by some as a tacit rebuke of the progovernment legislature. China\u2019s Communist Party has changed a once defiant city\u2014with barely a whimper from abroad. Mr Lai\u2019s case, which is the first related to foreign collusion, looks likely to establish precedents both legally and socially.\n\nThe party\u2019s control centres on the NSL. It was promulgated by the national parliament in Beijing in 2020 in the wake of the unrest in Hong Kong the year before. The NSL created sweeping, ambiguous categories of crime previously unknown in Hong Kong, such as subversion and the collusion of which Mr Lai was accused. Another set of rules passed last year, \u201cArticle 23 legislation\u201d, introduced harsher sentences for national-security offences. Trials under both the NSL and Article 23 legislation can be held without juries and involve judges drawn from a special pool.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s authorities seem on edge. On December 6th representatives of around a dozen international media outlets, including The Economist, were summoned by the national-security police and "
