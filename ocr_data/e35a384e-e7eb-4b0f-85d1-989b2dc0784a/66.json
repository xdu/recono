It has sold more than 70m copies since the first version in 1991. The more militarily focused Total War series invites players to take command of intricately simulated armies in historical periods from feudal Japan to Napoleonic Europe or Republican Rome. The influence of such games goes beyond entertainment. In 2021 Nicholas Mulder, a historian at Cornell University, noted on Twitter that a new kind of student was turning up in his class on early-modern Europe; one whose interest had been explicitly sparked by Europa Universalis 4. \u201cYou'll get at least a few in every class,\u201d agrees Bret Devereaux, a historian at North Carolina State University. As he put it on his blog: teachers now encounter self-taught history buffs for whom \u201cParadox [games are] the historical mother tongue, and actual history is only a second language.\u201d\n\n1444 AND ALL THAT\n\nThe idea of simulating history in games is not new. Perhaps the best way to think of a game like Europa Universalis is as a fever-dream remix of Risk, a board game first published in 1957. But whereas board games have to have fairly simple rules, in a video game a machine keeps track of everything. That means those rules and systems can become very complex indeed.\n\nRisk divides the world into a few dozen territories, and allows for up to six players. The map in EUs features thousands of territories and hundreds of different polities, from tiddlers such as the Free Imperial City of Bremen to historical big cheeses such as the Byzantine Empire. The player chooses one; the computer controls the rest, but all are active participants in the game. The game keeps an eye on everything from armies and navies to a state\u2019s administrative capacity, its diplomatic relations and its trade.\n\nPlaying for the first time can be bewildering. Players must conduct diplomacy with vassals and rivals, manage their economies, pacify peasant revolts and balance fractious interest groups. EU4, the previous game in the series, starts in 1444. Play as England and the decisions come thick and fast. Should the royals accept a marriage proposal from Leinster? Should you honour the Treaty of Tours (signed just before the game starts) and hand over Maine, a chunk of English territory in what is now France? Or will you go back on your word and risk reigniting the Hundred Years War? Will you grant a monopoly on the wool trade? And what to do about Scotland, your northern rival?\n\nThat means the games are practically certain to generate \u201calternate histories\u201d, in which the world develops along a different path from the one it actually took. If England does manage to hang on to Maine in EU4, for instance, the country can be played as a land power rather than the maritime one it actually became. But doing so may also spark another war with France\u2014albeit one that England can sometimes win. An ambitious Dai Viet player can turn the historical tables and conquer China. Academic historians are often sniffy about alternate history. But it can be a good way to get students thinking about the subject as more than a tedious list of events, says Jeremiah McCall, who teaches history at Cincinnati Country Day School and has written on the educational uses of games.\n\nThink of a game like Europa Universalis as\n\na fever-dream remix of Risk\n\nThe Economist December 20th 2025\n\nIt is this freewheeling agency, adds Dr McCall, that makes games\u2014especially those that lean towards simulation rather than linear narratives\u2014a unique form of media. Reading about history is a passive experience. Play a game, and you have to get your hands dirty.\n\nPeople will learn things while they are having fun, too, via something that Ian Bogost, a video-game critic, dubs \u201cprocedural rhetoric\u201d\u2014the ideas and assumptions that the rules and systems of a game smuggle, often unnoticed, into the player\u2019s mind. An obvious one is a better knowledge of what the past looked like; that the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was a behemoth in its day, or that an unwise royal marriage risks giving foreign rulers a claim to your throne.\n\nAnother idea, more profound, is that history did not have to happen the way it did. Some of Paradox\u2019s earlier games try to keep things trundling roughly along their historical tracks by forcing certain big events\u2014the Manchu conquest of China, say, or the Reformation in Northern Europe\u2014to happen mostly on schedule. But that \u201crailroading\u201d, as players call it, has diminished in later releases in favour of letting the simulation play out as it will.\n\nSome of the lessons can be surprisingly sophisticated. Dr Devereaux has written about how Paradox\u2019s games can teach players about a concept known in international relations as the \u201csecurity dilemma\u2019, without ever mentioning the phrase. The idea is that though economic growth is not a zero-sum game, security is. A state may beef up its own army because it is feeling insecure next to powerful neighbours. But that makes that country seem more threatening, prodding those next door to build bigger armies, too.\n\nDr Devereaux uses Burgundy in \u00a3U\u00a2 to illustrate the baleful consequences. It begins the game next to an expansionist France, with its territory dangerously split in two. To play Burgundy is to fret constantly about France\u2019s intentions and your own precarious position. To safeguard your country, you need to become more powerful. Before the Industrial Revolution, when almost the entire economy is built on agriculture, the easiest way to do that is to acquire more land. That draws the player\u2019s eye inexorably to the small statelets of the Holy Roman Empire to the east. \u201cTo avoid becoming a victim of France,\u201d writes Dr Devereaux, \u201cBurgundy effectively must victimise its own smaller neighbours.\u201d But those neighbours face the same incentives, as you will discover if you play as them. It is one thing to read about the security dilemma in a textbook. It is another to experience it for yourself.\n\nThe strength of games like Europa Universalis\u2014 that they are simulations, with consistent rules\u2014can also be a weakness. Savvy players can exploit the systems, and the unimaginative play of their computer opponents. And if a decision proves catastrophic, the player can always reload and avoid making it again, an option unavailable to real historical decision-makers.\n\nBut all forms of media are imperfect. Dissecting a game\u2019s assumptions and flaws is good practice for doing the same to academic articles or historical sources. History is not in fashion today: science and engineering degrees are in the ascendancy. Something that makes history\u2014or at least a gamified version of it\u2014so alluring that students will voluntarily sink hundreds of hours into \u201cis a huge positive\u201d for the field, says Dr Devereaux. \u201cNo question about it\u201d @ "
