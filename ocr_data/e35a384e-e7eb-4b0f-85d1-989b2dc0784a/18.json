  "text": "STRANGELY, EVERY THING WE BUILD TURNS OUT TO BEA SPORTS CAR.\n\nOver 20 years ago, we built a Porsche you can share. Exhilaration for five. Thrills for every road.\n\nThe Cayenne redefined SUV sport performance. From the efficiency of the E-Hybrid,\n\nto the ferocity of the Cayenne Turbo GT.\n\nThat family pedigree just got stronger. This time, the feeling is electrified.\n\nThe Cayenne Turbo Electric accelerates from O\u201460 mph in 2.4 seconds and completes the quarter-mile dash in just 9.9 seconds.\n\nIt has a suspension comfortable for rocky roads,\n\nyet sharp enough for the Nurburgring.\n\nAn interior crafted with handpicked materials.\n\nAn exterior with aeroblades that make air itself cooperate.\n\nWhether it's powered by the growl of a V8, or the instant surge of electrification, every Cayenne is built for one thing:\n\nto make you feel.\n\nPorsche. There is no substitute.\n\n\u2014ORS>C ee\n\n\u00a9 2025 Porsche Cars North America, Inc. "
