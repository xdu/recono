Nearly 400 Palestinians are reported to have been killed by the IDF since the ceasefire began.\n\nAnd yet despite all indications that the ceasefire has merely been a transition to a low-level bitter war of attrition, American officials seem convinced that Mr Trump\u2019s plan is moving forward. The \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d he plans to chair will be announced very soon, they promise. The ISF and Gaza\u2019s new technocratic government will materialise any day, they insist. American contractors with close ties to the administration have already visited the area, sniffing for opportunities.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, disagreements between Israel and America on how to implement the next stage are deepening. The administration wants to use its planned communities\u2014compounds of prefabricated homes that will include schools and clinics\u2014as a proof of concept. These compounds will take months to build and provide homes for only a fraction of the population. But the administration believes they will show it can fulfil much more ambitious reconstruction plans. They envisage Israel withdrawing from the areas around the new compounds and ISF troops securing them while talks continue over Hamas\u2019s disarmament.\n\nIsrael sees things differently. It shows no sign of withdrawing. Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir, the IDF\u2019s chief of staff, has called the Yellow Line a new border. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, wants the IDF to control access to the compounds and allow in only Gazans who have been screened by Israel. Sources close to Mr Netanyahu claim this is the only way to isolate Hamas and force it to disarm\u2014 though another military campaign, they say, may also be needed. Israel\u2019s security types are less convinced. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no way we're going to get enough Gazans to move to the Yellow Zone\u201d to allow for this, says one official.\n\nAnother major point of contention between the Israelis and the Americans is the inclusion of Turkey in the ISF. For Israel, this is a red line. The Turkish government has hosted Hamas leaders and imposed a trade embargo on Israel. Mr Trump, however, has grown closer to Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and is eager to take advantage of his aspirations to be a power in Gaza.\n\nMr Trump has summoned Mr Netanyahu to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida home, on December 29th. The president is expected to press him to accept his version of the second stage of his peace plan. \u201cNetanyahu can\u2019t fold on the Turkish issue,\u201d predicts one Israeli diplomat. \u201cBut he will have to concede on other matters.\u201d Mr Trump, who wants some big announcements on Gaza in January, is losing patience. @\n\nHealth care in Gaza\n\nOn its knees\n\nThe health-care system in Gaza is in ruins. And no one is rebuilding it\n\nT: GRASP THE magnitude of the task of rebuilding Gaza, look at its health-care system. From buildings to medics, it is shattered. Out of 35 hospitals and clinics in Gaza evaluated by the UN, six have been flattened; 11 are out of commission; only parts of 18 can be used. Several hospitals are in the half of the strip controlled by Israel, out of reach for most Palestinians. Of the 18 partially functioning hospitals and clinics, 16 cannot dispose of infectious waste properly, 15 do not have dependable electricity, 13 lack decent toilets and sinks and 11 lack reliable clean water. In Gaza just 74 intensive-care beds and 215 emergency-room beds remain.\n\nSupplies of everything from fuel and drugs to bags of saline, syringe needles and gauze are scarce or non-existent. There are no MRI machines in northern Gaza and just one functional CT scanner. Newborns in critical condition have to share incubators. At Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, the largest in the south, the glass on the main autoclave, used to sterilise equipment, was shattered by a bullet during the war and has not been replaced. Medics dealing with amputations, burns and limb or spinal trauma have just five sets of skin-grafting surgical tools in the entire strip. \u201cNormally each hospital would have at least four,\u201d says Dr Victoria Rose, a British surgeon who has been into Gaza three times since October 2023.\n\nNo beds available\n\nMiddle East & Africa 37\n\nIsrael still prevents anything it considers \u201cdual use\u201d from entering Gaza. That includes surgical instruments, X-ray equipment and solar-powered refrigerators used to store drugs. The list of dual-use items is unclear and inconsistent. Aid workers say Israeli officials confiscate stethoscopes and operating glasses.\n\nAt least 1,722 health-care workers were killed during the war, about 10% of the workforce. About 80 who were arrested are thought to remain in Israeli jails. Many more fled. Those left have been working flat out, enduring the same air strikes, food and water shortages as all Gazans.\n\nNor can Gazans easily get medical help elsewhere. Before October 2023 between 50 and 100 patients would leave the strip every day for treatments such as radiotherapy in East Jerusalem and elsewhere. Since then 10,600 patients have been evacuated, the equivalent of about 13 a day. More than 18,500, including 4,000 children, are waiting to leave for treatment, says the World Health Organisation (WHO). Between July 2024 and October 2025 more than 930 died waiting to be evacuated.\n\nTelemedicine could provide some relief. Specialist teams outside Gaza can offer advice remotely on the right course of action for individual patients, an approach that was used before the latest conflict. Diagnostic tools such as the CAD4TB software, which uses artificial intelligence to detect tuberculosis in digital chest X-rays, could speed up screening and treatment.\n\nNor is the damage only physical. Experts assume that every child in Gaza has suffered trauma that will have a severe impact on their behavioural, mental and emotional development. \u201cThey have all had to live under acute life threat every single day,\u201d says Katrin Glatz Brubakk, a Norwegian child psychologist who has been to Gaza twice since August 2024. \u201cThey have all lost family members or friends. They have all [seen] people dismembered.\u201d\n\nChildren with severe trauma form fewer neural connections in their prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that is essential to everything from decision-making to learning, problem-solving and emotional regulation. To provide care, \u201cyou don\u2019t only need psych wards,\u201d says Dr Glatz Brubakk. \u201cYou need to rebuild homes and schools\u2014 preferably also a football field.\u201d In other words, some kind of normal life.\n\nPutting the health-care system back together will take years. The WHO puts the cost at $7bn-8bn. The Hamas-run ministry of health has drawn up a 49-page \u201cearly recovery plan\u201d which estimates it will take five years to rebuild a \u201csmarter and more sustainable\u201d system. But removing Hamas from power is central to Donald Trump\u2019s peace plan, so the ministry\u2019s proposal may not be implemented any time soon. In the meantime, Gazans will suffer. "
