  "text": "The Economist November 22nd 2025\n\nLeaders 11\n\nPay floors\n\nTime for a pause\n\nWhy governments should stop raising the minimum wage\n\nc IS EASY to see why politicians like raising the minimum wage. Short of cash yet keen to fight inequality, they have seized on a tool of redistribution that costs governments little and wins votes. In its budget on November 26th Britain is likely to raise the minimum wage, which sits at 61% of median income, up from 48% a decade ago. Germany introduced a minimum wage only in 2015; by 2023 it had crossed 50%. And although America\u2019s federal rate of $7.25 an hour has not changed since 2009, many states and cities controlled by Democrats have raised their pay floors far higher. The average effective minimum wage is around $12 per hour; the highest is over $21.\n\nIn one respect the surging minimum wage is a triumph for economists. Having originally been sceptics, they embraced the policy around the turn of the millennium, arguing that wage floors did not eliminate jobs as they once feared\u2014a finding that the experience of the past two decades seemed to confirm. Yet as we report this week (see Finance & economics section), just as governments are championing the consensus, scholars are getting cold feet. A growing body of research suggests that minimum wages distort economies in ways that do not immediately appear in jobs numbers.\n\nOne worry is that it takes time for minimum wages to kill jobs. Evidence from a big hike to Seattle\u2019s pay floor in 2015 and 2016 suggests hiring at the bottom end of the labour market slowed by 10%, even though existing workers were typically not laid off. Another is that higher minimums degrade jobs rather than destroy them. When employers must pay more, but can still hire easily, they may cut corners elsewhere. New research finds that big increases in the minimum wage are associated with shorter or less predictable working hours, more workplace accidents and fewer perks such as health insurance.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nMinimum wage as % of median\n\nPoland J \u2014 ao\n\nEe 2010 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n\nA final risk is that early success breeds overconfidence. Moderate minimum wages can, counterintuitively, make jobs more abundant, by offsetting the bargaining power of big employers, who would otherwise restrain hiring to suppress pay. But the more governments embrace big hikes, the more likely they are to eliminate jobs\u2014just as a big enough tax rise will reduce revenue. One recent peer-reviewed estimate puts the average American minimum wage that corrects for employer market power at under $8.\n\nBeyond that, the minimum wage is a crude and wasteful tool for redistribution. Many minimum-wage workers are not poor, but live with higher earners. And when firms raise prices to offset their steeper costs, it is the poor who suffer most\u2014more so than from sales taxes, according to one paper.\n\nPoliticians should beware these effects. Although raising minimum wages invariably polls well, electorates everywhere are also angry about soaring prices and a crisis of affordability. There is a danger of a doom loop in which employers\u2019 higher costs are passed on to consumers, making life still less affordable, including for the very workers governments are trying to help. Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York, has promised to raise the minimum wage from $16.50 today to $30 by 2030. Prices would rise significantly as a result, making an already expensive place to live even dearer.\n\nThere are better ways to help low earners. In-work tax credits are better targeted towards the poor and, if paid for with growth-friendly taxes, less harmful to the economy. They may lack the appeal of minimum wages, the costs of which are well hidden. But after a decade of aggressive increases, the responsible option is not to go higher still. It is to stop. &\n\n718 |\u00a7 [8\n\nUkraine\n\nThe power and the fury\n\nA corruption scandal provokes justified outrage. But the West should still help Ukraine defend itself\n\nN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER likens it to an atomic bomb exA pioding in Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s face. A scandal involving kickbacks and money-laundering centred on Energoatom, a state-owned nuclear-power agency, is fast becoming the worst crisis Ukraine\u2019s president has faced since Russia invaded his country almost four years ago. Two ministers have already been removed, one arrested; more high-level casualties seem certain. For Ukraine\u2019s Western supporters, the news is infuriating. For ordinary Ukrainians\u2014whether fighting on the front or living under daily Russian missile and drone attacks\u2014it is far worse. While their country is engaged in an existential struggle, bigwigs are alleged to have misappropriated huge sums, perhaps $100m (see Europe section). If guilty, they have de-\n\nprived their own troops of resources.\n\nOutrage is justified. But it is vital to understand what this scandal means\u2014and what it does not. First, the graft it reveals is not new. Ukraine, though far less corrupt than Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, has a long history of sleaze. The Western mission to encourage reform was always destined to be slow. The effort predates Mr Zelensky and will outlast him.\n\nSecond\u2014if you squint\u2014the scandal contains a glimmer of good news. Despite Mr Zelensky\u2019s clumsy and quickly reversed attempt to curb their independence in July, the country\u2019s anti-corruption agencies appear able to do their job. That is precisely what Ukraine\u2019s supporters have hoped to see, and today\u2019s revelations may end up strengthening them. "
