China sees Europe as a has-been\n\n4 _ Re = |\n\nnes LEADERS reserve some of their fiercest criticism for themselves. They are admirably blunt in diagnosing their political and economic problems, if sadly not as adept at fixing them. Yet if they are feeling especially masochistic, they should consider travelling to China. There they will find much of their own selfcriticism amplified\u2014but in harsher tones.\n\nEuropeans endlessly debate how to avoid becoming trapped between America and China. For many in China that seems needless. \u201cEurope is incapable of truly breaking free from America to become independent,\u201d opined a scholar from Fudan University in a recent article. As for challenges to European unity, Eurocrats love to navel-gaze. In China critics go a step further. \u201cWhether the European Union can even survive until 2035 is a question,\u201d Zhang Weiwei, a nationalist academic, said on television in September.\n\nAnd these are just the public comments. In private, as Chaguan recently heard from a range of Chinese scholars, the opinions are often more scathing. Europe is a bit like an ageing concubine who cannot accept that she has been ditched by her American emperor, says one consultant. \u201cEurope hates innovation,\u201d says another. This disdain can sometimes seep into official affairs. A European business representative reports that on a recent visit to the Chinese foreign ministry he was greeted with a wolf-warrior-like berating\u2014mainly, he surmised, for the sport of it.\n\nThe analysis that Europe is weak and divided is not entirely wrong. But the Chinese view tends towards a caricature of Europe\u2019s challenges, and this leads to two blind spots in China\u2019s approach to Europe. The first is to assume that Europe largely follows America\u2019s lead. Over the past few years many, though not all, Chinese analysts have applied this lens to the war in Ukraine. At its core they see the conflict as pitting America against Russia. From this perspective, Europe craves peace and stability, but it is brutish America that wants to prolong the war at little cost to itself in order to weaken Russia. Few reflect on why most European leaders see the war in Ukraine as a direct threat.\n\nAnother example came in September when the Dutch government decided to seize control at Nexperia, a Chinese-owned, Netherlands-headquartered chipmaker\u2014a move partially re-\n\nversed in recent days after a stand-off. The Dutch could scream until blue in the face that they acted of their own volition to counter risks to their economic security, but Chinese observers would not believe it. Surely, a small country behaving so boldly must be doing America\u2019s bidding.\n\nThe other blind spot is to believe that China somehow offers Europe a way out of its problems. Chinese scholars reason that Europe, like any rational middle power, wants to find a balance between China and America. In recent weeks China\u2019s commerce ministry has talked about restarting trade negotiations. It apparently has not given up on an investment pact that stalled in 2021 amid a row over China\u2019s actions in Xinjiang, a region situated in the country\u2019s north-west.\n\nYet such pining for deals betrays insufficient recognition of the extent to which China\u2019s economic model has become a major concern for Europe in its own right. In the past few years alone, Germany\u2019s trade relations with China have shifted from being basically in balance to running a gargantuan deficit on track to exceed $100bn this year. European companies that long profited from the Chinese market now see it as their fiercest competitor. And although it was a response to Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, China\u2019s export-control regime for rare earths was as disruptive to European companies as to American ones. It was a lesson for Europe in the dangers of dependence on China.\n\nThings are getting tetchier on the diplomatic front. In June the EU scuttled an economic dialogue with China because of a lack of progress on trade disputes. In October Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, postponed a visit to Beijing when he was not offered the usual array of high-level meetings. The Chinese, for their part, were upset that Mr Wadephul had used a speech in Japan to criticise China\u2019s \u201cincreasingly aggressive\u201d behaviour in Asian waters. And European officials in Beijing report that Chinese ministries have taken the unusual step of refusing d\u00e9marches, or requests for formal diplomatic meetings. One European representative says that China is simply bored with Europe\u2019s hectoring and feels able to ignore it.\n\nOne-sided rivalry\n\nIndeed, China sees little reason to worry about a souring of its relations with Europe. Policy officials in Beijing seem confident that they have already outmanoeuvred Mr Trump in the trade war, and think that dispatching Europe will be even easier. What is more, China has much experience in cultivating warmer ties with individual European countries to neuter their cohesion as a bloc. These days, it has identified Hungary and, increasingly, Spain as two countries that are especially receptive to Chinese investment. Moreover, even when Europe acts, as with tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, it remains constrained by its deep commitment to rules. Bureaucrats in Brussels do not strike fear into the hearts of the hard men in Beijing.\n\nIs China at risk of miscalculating? So long as the Ukraine war continues with China backing Russia\u2019s pariah, Vladimir Putin, Europe\u2019s relationship with China is unlikely to improve. Meanwhile, on trade, Europe\u2019s views are fast evolving. A continued surge in Chinese exports could provoke Europe to take more measures\u2014some possibly aggressive\u2014to head off the threat. If that happens, it would be a demonstration of Europe\u2019s stiffening backbone. But Beijing, convinced that America calls the shots, might still miss what matters: Europe\u2019s new anger is its own. "
