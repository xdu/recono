  "text": "48 Europe\n\nThe Economist November 22nd 2025\n\nCHARLEMAGNE All aboard the EU omnibus\n\nEurope is on a deregulation drive. Will it go anywhere?\n\nOLITICIANS KEEN to flaunt their dislike of excessive bureauc-\n\nracy have a wealth of visual metaphors to choose from. Javier Milei wooed Argentine voters by wielding a chainsaw. Donald Trump has been photographed cutting Washington\u2019s metaphorical red tape with oversize gold scissors. Britain\u2019s David Cameron once promised a risky-sounding \u201cbonfire of regulations\u201d. Still, that left plenty of clich\u00e9s for the European Union\u2019s top brass to choose from, when they recently\u2014and belatedly\u2014embarked on a bid to lighten the continent\u2019s bureaucratic burden. Perhaps a pressurewasher to cleanse the statute books? A sledgehammer to reduce unwanted regulation to rubble? Not quite. The prop picked for the EU\u2019s efforts to roll back officialdom is the omnibus, the most plodding means of transport known to man. (It is also a piece of euro-jargon used to describe a catch-all legislative proposal.) In terms of dynamism, the image lacks a certain je ne sais quoi.\n\nEurope\u2019s regulatory cake is multilayered; one might call it a bureaucratic mille-feuille. Citizens and companies are subject to edicts from every rank of government, at local, regional, national and EU level. They must hope one tier\u2019s rules do not contradict another\u2019s. Businesses spend around \u20ac15obn ($173bn) a year in a frenzy of form-filling. A regulation adopted three years ago requires large firms to provide up to 1,155 data points on what is happening in their global supply chains, in effect forcing them to recruit boxtickers dedicated to tracking Indonesian labour conditions and the like. Citizens are no better off. Internet doomscrolling these days requires batting away repeated \u201ccookie\u201d requests from each website, supposedly for the benefit of Europeans\u2019 privacy. In Spain professionals known as gestores have sprung up to help locals wrangle with the bureaucracy: they are part fixer, part therapist for those traumatised by endless paper-shuffling. Across Europe housing projects are delayed as report after report is commissioned to establish the mating habits of some local toad.\n\nIt turns out all that bureaucracy is bad for economic growth\u2014 who knew? Europeans who worry that they are falling further behind America, and failing to innovate at China\u2019s pace, have turned lately to talk of competitiveness. Last year a report by Mario Draghi, a former Italian prime minister, proposed a raft of mea-\n\nsures including cutting red tape, deepening the single market and massive investment to boost productivity. But European governments lack the spare cash to splurge on innovation, and completing the single market requires taking on entrenched interest groups. Bashing excessive bureaucracy is what's left.\n\nSo, with the zeal of the convert, the European Commission has begun taking on red tape. It is a paradoxical place to start. The EU\u2019s executive arm is to rule-making what Taiwan is to microchips and Champagne is to sparkling wine: the undisputed world champion. Between 2019 and 2024 the bloc passed nearly 14,000 legal acts. No facet of daily life has been left untouched. Everything from the fruit content of marmalade or the weight of paper used in official correspondence is mandated from on high. Even the future has been regulated with anticipatory gusto: rules hemming in artificial-intelligence models were drafted, in large part, even before Silicon Valley had devised the models they were to regulate.\n\nThe EU\u2019s original plan had been not to cut regulation so much as to avoid adding to it. In 2021 it promised that at least one piece of legislation would be cut for every one coming into force. When that proved insufficient, a plan for \u201csimplification\u201d was devised\u2014 the EU would keep the old rules, but make it easier for businesses to comply. The aim was to cut the cost of meeting regulation by 25%, for example by gutting those pesky supply-chain regulations. But lately Ursula von der Leyen, the commission\u2019s president and thus the person holding the omnibus\u2019s steering wheel, has begun speaking of outright \u201cderegulation\u201d. That means scrapping rules. What will be left for the gestores to do?\n\nSix wide-ranging omnibus laws have already been tabled, taking in everything from supply-chain disclosure and farming to defence. On November 19th an overhaul of EU digital diktats was unveiled, rowing back on the hastily devised AI rules. Another fleet of omnibuses is expected by year end, with more to come in 2026. The tone has changed in EU circles. Until recently staff crowed of \u201cthe Brussels effect\u201d, whereby companies from across the world were made to bend to EU rules if they wanted to sell stuff to European consumers\u2014often forcing American firms to adopt them across their global operations for simplicity\u2019s sake. Now the mantra is that Europe should avoid overreaching, and accept that its way of regulating business is not necessarily best.\n\nOmnibus, meet roadblock\n\nAlas, the EU\u2019s decision-making red tape is itself holding back the red-tape-chopping efforts. The first omnibus law, which included shredding the supply-chain rules, was announced in February, but has yet to be formally adopted. After initially being voted down by the European Parliament, the measure went through last week thanks only to the support of right-wing populist MEPs. This is politically noxious for centrists like Mrs von der Leyen.\n\nThe EU\u2019s bid to curb batty regulations is clearly welcome. But the passengers on Mrs von der Leyen\u2019s omnibus are entitled to feel a bit whiplashed. This columnist certainly is: the commission officials who boast to him of cutting what they describe as ill-considered burdensome regulations in 2025 are in some cases the very same ones who drafted the rules that came into force in 2024. And for every omnibus gearing up to deregulate, there is another vehicle headed in the opposite direction. By the EU\u2019s own estimates new laws currently in the pipeline could add around \u20ac8obn a year to annual business costs\u2014far more than is being cut. That will leave plenty for future omnibuses to take on. All aboard! @ "
