  "text": "22 United States\n\nof an electric-truck manufacturer, and Paul Walczak, a health-care executive. Mr Milton and his wife had donated $1.8m to the president\u2019s 2024 campaign. Mr Walczak\u2019s mother had recently paid $1m to attend a dinner at Mar-a-Lago; he cited her donation history in his pardon application. Normally the Department of Justice (DoJ) requires pardon-seekers to wait five years after conviction or release to apply: better to show remorse and reform. By contrast the pardons for Mr Milton and Mr Walczak came quickly, sparing both men prison and multi-million-dollar restitutions.\n\nSuch pardons have ignited a lobbying frenzy among white-collar convicts. Sam Mangel, a clemency consultant, says he has been retained by 28 applicants this year, up from one during Joe Biden\u2019s entire term. He gets inquiries daily. Some lobbyists who market \u201cexecutive relief\u201d charge seven-figure success fees on top of their retainers. The practice is a throwback to the Tudor court\u2014except today\u2019s intercessors don\u2019t accept falcons. Meanwhile Mr Trump\u2019s neutering of Congress has shifted K Street\u2019s focus away from Capitol Hill and given rise to a new crop of lobbyists with ties to the White House.\n\nMoney permeates American politics, via unlimited super-PAC spending and lobbying fees. During the first Trump administration watchdogs warned about the possibility of influence-buying via the president\u2019s real-estate business. They worried that firms and foreign governments would spend big at his hotels to curry favour. Today this looks quaint. The president\u2019s entry into the crypto business offers more opportunities for \u2014 self-enrichment\u2014and greater riches. Estimates by Reuters suggest that revenues at the Trump Organisation reached $864m in the first half of the year, up from $51m a year ago. More than 90% came from crypto.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s pardon of Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, captures this new swill of influence. Last year Mr Zhao spent four months in prison after pleading guilty to facilitating money-laundering. Binance was booted from the American market. Around the same time Binance reportedly helped build a stablecoin for World Liberty Financial, a crypto firm in which the Trump family owns a large stake. (Binance denies this.) In May a fund based in the United Arab Emirates, MGX, said it would buy $2bn-worth of World Liberty\u2019s tokens. The transaction has netted the Trumps millions this year.\n\nTwo weeks later Mr Trump agreed to let the UAE buy the most coveted AI chips\u2014a privilege denied by the Biden administration, on account of Emirati chumminess with China. Negotiating the chip deal for the Americans was Steve Witkoff, Mr Trump\u2019s envoy, whose son is the boss of\n\nWorld Liberty. Opposite Mr Witkoff was the brother of the Emirati crown prince, the chairman of MGx. The White House and World Liberty deny that the UAE\u2019s crypto deal unlocked the chips. And yet a quid pro quo was hardly necessary; the incentives on both sides were clear enough.\n\nAnother feature of the new order is the Trump administration\u2019s choice not to prosecute some forms of graft. The DoJ has gutted its political-corruption unit and vastly narrowed the scope to bring foreignbribery cases. The department has also dropped charges against Eric Adams, New York\u2019s outgoing mayor, and a probe into Tom Homan, Mr Trump\u2019s border tsar. Both men denied the allegations against them. Since January the president has pardoned ten politicians convicted of various forms of self-dealing.\n\nScholars understand patronage as a way to communicate politically. Mr Trump is unabashed, which is part of the point,\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene\n\nMAGA's big break-up\n\nWASHINGTON, DC\n\nThe Epstein files opened fissures in Trumpworld\n\nFY EMBODY the conspiracy-peddling instincts of the MAGA movement fringes more fully than Marjorie Taylor Greene. The congresswoman from Georgia, a reflexive Donald Trump loyalist, has always been light on policy and heavy on theatrics and outrage. Some of her most infamous hits include: an antiSemitic screed about a space laser controlled by the Rothschilds,\n\nBipartisan role model\n\nThe Economist November 22nd 2025\n\nnotes Jacob Eisler of Florida State University. He is telegraphing to the MAGA base that he disdains norms and Democratic hand-wringing about the rule of law.\n\nPatrimonialism is a means to bolster political power, too. By not prosecuting graft by others, or by pardoning the crimes of political allies, Mr Trump incentivises their co-operation. Equally, opposition or recalcitrance invites punishment. One of the Doj\u2019s few political-corruption indictments this year targets the former chief of staff of Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s Democratic governor and a prominent antagonist of Mr Trump.\n\nThe insidious thing about corruption is that the public will never know what motivates policy, says Richard Briffault of Columbia University. Was that chip deal or this tariff break a credible decision made in the national interest, or a finagle made in Mr Trump\u2019s self-interest? Was it both? Who knows. @\n\na craving for QAnon kookery and, more prominently, repeated claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Mr Trump.\n\nIt was therefore startling when she turned sharply against the president during an interview with CNN on November 16th. \u201cHe called me a traitor...those are the types of words that can radicalise people...and put my life in danger.\u201d When prodded about her own role in amplifying America\u2019s noxious political discourse, Ms Greene fessed up: \u201cI would like to say, humbly, I\u2019m sorry for taking part in the toxic politics; it\u2019s very bad for our country.\u201d\n\nThe immediate cause for the bust-up between Ms Greene and Mr Trump is the Jeffrey Epstein affair, involving a dead sex offender with links to the president and other prominent figures. Ms Greene\u2019s defection was the latest break between the president and a stalwart of his MAGA movement, and a sign that Mr Trump\u2019s grip on congressional Republicans is loosening a bit, at least where Epstein is concerned.\n\nFor months the White House had pressed congressional Republicans to vote against a discharge petition that would compel the Department of Justice to release whatever files it has on Epstein. Ms Greene vocally supported the bill. In a stinging social-media post on November 14th, Mr Trump recanted his endorsement\n\nof Ms Greene, called her a \u201clunatic\u201d and \u00bb "
