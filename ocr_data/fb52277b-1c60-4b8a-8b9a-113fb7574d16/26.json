  "text": "26 United States\n\nThe Economist November 22nd 2025\n\nLEXINGTON Say it aint Foe\n\nDonald Trump has started down the same path as Foe Biden\n\nes YOU cast your mind back to when the presidency of Joe Biden was young and full of hope? It may not be easy, given the distracting din of Democratic teeth still gnashing about his leadership. Yet only four years ago his administration was being hailed as extraordinary, maybe on a par with that of the most transformational Democrat, Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nIn his first 100 days Mr Biden issued more important executive actions than any president since Roosevelt and, to combat the crises he faced, won authority from Congress to spend more money than Roosevelt did for the emergencies of his time. He distributed vaccines against covid to 200m people. Fully 59% of Americans approved of the job he was doing. Marvelling at Mr Biden, political and academic eminences saw a revival of Roosevelt\u2019s joyful spirit and his ideal of activist government. By August Politico was reporting that \u201cthe impulse to compare the two men has become commonplace in Washington.\u201d\n\nEven after the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan at the end of that month, when public approval of Mr Biden turned negative on net, never to recover, his ambition did not flag: he was still out to enact a new vision of American industrial policy, to overcome the climate crisis, to bring racial inequities into historic balance. Despite the slimmest of Democratic margins in Congress, only the Supreme Court seemed able to blunt his agenda. That no red wave came ashore in the midterms helped Mr Biden keep his grip on his party. But his greatest source of strength became fear\u2014 not of him, but that a primary challenger, or even criticism or dissent, would only weaken him in the next general election. That is why some of the most ambitious Democrats stuck by him even after his catastrophic debate. It all seems a bit mad, in retrospect.\n\nThe saga of Joe Biden is a reminder that the story of a president in the first year is never the same in his last. (Or the same as the story becomes decades later, when the revisionists get to work.) Americans have been demanding dramatic change since the century began, but have recoiled when presidents delivered their versions of it. That does not mean the latest president to overreach, Donald Trump, is heading down the same path. But he may be. Indeed, he has been down this darkling lane before. \u201cWe are very,\n\nvery close to being able to ignore Trump most nights,\u201d the rightwing media figure Tucker Carlson texted an associate as Mr Trump\u2019s first term was stumbling to an end. \u201cI truly can\u2019t wait.\u2019\n\nIn neither of Mr Trump\u2019s terms has the public ever approved of him nearly as much as it sometimes did of Mr Biden. This term Mr Trump has already again plumbed the depths of Mr Biden\u2019s approval (37% in the Gallup poll: Mr Biden took more than two years to fall that far before recovering slightly; Mr Trump got there in July, before drifting up, to 41%). Mr Trump has been far busier and more \u201ctransformational\u201d than Mr Biden. He has greater strength as a communicator and unmatched ruthlessness, or shamelessness, in applying power. Still, Mr Trump is making the same sorts of mistakes, beyond interpreting a narrow victory as a mandate for radicalism. The political bill could come due sooner since, skilled though he is at scaring Republicans, he cannot run again.\n\nThe most obvious mutual mistake, as has been widely noted, is denialism about inflation. Mr Biden called it temporary. Though Mr Trump experimented in April with hard truths about tariffs, saying children should be satisfied \u201cwith two dolls instead of 30 dolls\u201d, he has generally insisted tariffs do not cause inflation, that, in fact, he has defeated inflation, prices are falling and \u201cwe have the greatest economy we\u2019ve ever had\u201d. Such Trumpian bluster often works. But in this case his whoppers are falsified in the daily lives of Americans and by the increasingly frantic efforts of his administration to bring prices down, including by cancelling tariffs. In The Economist's composite tracker of polls, Mr Trump\u2019s net approval on inflation and prices is 33 points to the negative.\n\nOn his signature issue, immigration, Mr Trump is committing his own version of Mr Biden\u2019s mistake, extremism. Mr Biden lifted most of Mr Trump\u2019s restrictions and then ignored the border for two years. Mr Trump started out with broad support for mass deportation, but polling suggests most Americans are unhappy with the brutal tactics of his growing force of border agents. Even Mr Trump himself has objected to some raids, prompting the sort of speculation that continues to this day about the Biden White House: does the president know what\u2019s going on? Is his policy actually being formulated and executed by his most radical aides?\n\nThe dude abidens\n\nAt 79 Mr Trump seems more active than Mr Biden ever was as president. And in his first term he concealed a perfectly routine medical procedure, a colonoscopy, out of a sense of personal dignity. So there may be nothing that should concern anyone about the MRI he had in October of a part of his body the White House has declined to disclose. Or perhaps that storyline could have a dismal twist in store, as was true for Mr Biden\u2014one that would leave Republicans fuming, as Democrats still do, over the president\u2019s stubbornness about holding on to power.\n\nMr Trump had reasonable concerns about how Mr Biden\u2019s relatives enriched themselves through his service. Yet the Trump family is making the \u201cBiden crime family\u201d look small-time. Whether or not Mr Trump is proven to be bidding out pardons, it is hard to imagine even a revisionist eventually celebrating the many ways he openly capitalises on the presidency, such as spritzing a flinching foreign leader in the Oval Office with the perfume he hawks, as he did this month (\u201cIt\u2019s the best fragrance,\u201d Mr Trump said). Mr Trump has time to correct his course. More probably, he will try to install a worshipful successor. But in the end, any successor will have a story all their own they want to tell. @ "
