But these official figures are not directly comparable with the AidData numbers. They exclude credit extended by the overseas subsidiaries of Chinese banks and leave out loans that finance foreign direct investment, which is recorded separately. The official figures also represent the stock of loans that remained outstanding at the end of 2023, whereas AidData have added up the flow of credit over the preceding 24 years.\n\nMr Parks and his team may also have identified loans that even China\u2019s authorities struggle to track. Their database spans over 1,100 lenders and donors. Although they are all owned by the Chinese state, its ministries do not have \u201cfull visibility on what all these different banks are doing\u201d, he explains. He and his team have, on more than one occasion, discovered that Chinese officials sometimes use the AidData figures in their own work. \u201cHaving a onestop shop where they can get all this information is too convenient to pass up,\u201d Mr Parks reckons.

Japan\u2019s new prime minister is an outspoken nationalist with a reputation as a China hawk. As it turned out, it took less than three weeks. On November 7th, in Japan\u2019s Diet, she was asked what might prompt Japan to exercise \u201ccollective self-defence\u201d. The term refers to Japan\u2019s proclaimed right to use military force to defend an ally, such as America, when deemed necessary for Japan\u2019s own survival. Her answer: if force is used against Taiwan. China is furious.\n\nGone is the polite tone, with warnings carefully veiled, that characterised China\u2019s official readouts of Ms Takaichi\u2019s meeting with China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, as recently as October. It took place at a gathering of regional leaders in South Korea, a few days after she took office. Mr Xi reportedly told her that China was willing to \u201cwork with Japan to...advance the strategic, mutually beneficial relationship\u201d (with the usual finger-wagging reference to Japan\u2019s wartime \u201chistory of aggression\u201d). Now it is pure vitriol. \u201cIf you stick that filthy neck where it doesn\u2019t belong, it\u2019s going to get sliced off. Are you ready for that?\u201d wrote China\u2019s consul-general in Osaka, Xue Jian, on X, a social-media platform.\n\nChina is probably not surprised by Ms Takaichi\u2019s words. In 2021 Aso Taro, then the deputy prime minister, said: \u201cIf a major problem took place in Taiwan, it would not be too much to say that it could relate to a survival-threatening situation [for Japan].\u201d A few days later a white paper issued by Japan\u2019s defence ministry said that \u201cstabilising the situation surrounding Taiwan\u201d was \u201cimportant for Japan\u2019s security\u201d. China was angry then, too.\n\nWhat makes it even more enraged this time is that the idea was conveyed by the prime minister herself and Japan is engaged in a military build-up, in part to deter China (see Asia section). In Beijing, officials have warned that Japan would face \u201ccrushing defeat\u201d were it to intervene in a conflict over Taiwan. The Communist Party\u2019s main mouthpiece, the People\u2019s Daily, said Ms Takaichi\u2019s remarks posed a \u201cgrave challenge\u201d to the post-1945 order. (Taiwan was under Japanese rule from 1895 to the end of the second world war, when China resumed control of it; at the end of China\u2019s civil war in 1949 the defeated Nationalist government took refuge there.)\n\nChina has also lashed out by advising\n\nChina 37\n\nits citizens to avoid travel to Japan, citing safety concerns. This could hurt Japan\u2019s tourist industry: this year about a fifth of foreign tourists in Japan have been Chinese. China has also advised students to reconsider studying in Japan. A report by Kiuchi Takahide of the Nomura Research Institute, a Japanese think-tank, said such warnings could cost Japan \u00a52.2trn ($14.2bn) in lost business, based on the impact of previous spats.\n\nOnce again, China appears to be stopping imports of Japanese seafood (it is only a few months since a similar ban, prompted by alleged safety concerns over wastewater from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant, was lifted). In Chinese cinemas, new releases of Japanese films are also being suspended. A social-media account run by China\u2019s state broadcaster noted that many Japanese products are \u201chighly reliant\u201d on Chinese imports. That raises the spectre of 2010, when China suspended sales of rare earths to Japan for a few weeks following Japan\u2019s arrest of a Chinese fishing-boat captain. In its recent trade war with America, China has re-used this weapon to powerful effect.\n\nMeanwhile, manoeuvres in recent days by China\u2019s coast guard and navy in the Yellow Sea and near the uninhabited Senkaku or Diaoyu islands (claimed by both countries) in the East China Sea have drawn attention, though they are hard to distinguish from China\u2019s usual exercises and posturing. On X George Glass, America\u2019s ambassador in Japan, wrote: \u201cIn case anyone was in doubt, the United States is fully committed to the defence of Japan, which includes the Senkaku Islands.\u201d\n\nDespite fulminations against Ms Takaichi on Chinese social media (often calling her a witch and punning on her surname, which sounds like \u201ctroublemaker\u201d in Chinese), it is unlikely that China will encourage large-scale public protests. For all his use of nationalism to rally support for the party, Mr Xi is nervous about unleashing it on the streets: there have been no largescale, nationwide, anti-foreign demonstrations in China since he took power in 2012.\n\nBut the spat could be lengthy. Ms Takaichi has said that she will avoid talking about specific scenarios relating to Taiwan in future, but has refused to retract her words, as China has demanded. She has no desire to appear weak so early in her tenure. Pressure on both sides is high. China abhors rhetorical adventurism on Taiwan, particularly under the island\u2019s current, defiant leader, Lai Ching-te. And Mr Xi\u2019s 2027 deadline for his forces to be capable of taking Taiwan is fast approaching\u2014Japanese involvement in a conflict could make their task far harder. As a tough nationalist leader faces another one in China, sparks are bound to fly. Relations may well get worse before they get better. @ "
