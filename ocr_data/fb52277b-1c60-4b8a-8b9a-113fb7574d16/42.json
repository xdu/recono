But there is a price for Israeli society in that strategy, cautions Rachel Azaria, the founder of an organisation that supports reservists\u2019 families. \u201cThe reservists are also the ones who in civilian life carry the burden of Israel\u2019s economy, its tech sector and academia.\u201d\n\nAt the same time Israel is seeing a national psychological crisis, argue Israeli experts. The extent to which the attacks of October 2023 and the war that has followed are to blame is hard to pin down. According to the IDF, 21 soldiers killed themselves in 2024, the highest number reported since 2011.

He argues that there needs to be a much wider response within Israeli society. The government has so far allocated 1.9bn shekels ($550m) for mental-health funding since the war began but the professionals warn this will not be enough. A military psychologist cautions: \u201cThe tailend of this war is a society in trauma.\u201d @\n\nIt is not just loans from China and Western financiers.\n\nDomestic borrowing is surging, too\n\nWO DECADES ago African debt was Thigh on the international agenda. In 2005 the G8, as the group of rich countries was then called, approved widespread debt relief for poor countries. As the G20 (a larger group that includes China and rising middle powers) prepares to meet in Johannesburg on November 22nd and 23rd, its first ever meeting in Africa, the South African organisers want global attention on indebtedness again. African debt is \u201cstifling public spending and economic growth\u2019, Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa\u2019s president, said ahead of the bash.\n\nMr Ramaphosa has a case. As a share of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s GDP, total government debt is 59%, roughly double what it was in 2012. The IMF classifies 20 countries in the region as in, or at high risk of, \u201cdebt distress\u201d. Some 32 African countries spend more on servicing their debts than they do on health care, with 25 spending more than they do on education. African countries are \u201cdefaulting on development\u201d, says Trevor Manuel, a former South African finance minister, who chairs a group advising the G20 on debt.\n\nBut today is not the 2000s. Western governments are not in a forgiving mood. Donald Trump is eschewing the summit and has told American officials to stay away. The G20\u2019s Common Framework, an initiative launched during the covid pandemic to organise restructuring, has led to relief equivalent to just 7% of the net present value of the debt stock in the four participating African countries, estimates the ONE Campaign, an advocacy group.\n\nEven if Western policymakers wanted to grant debt relief, they have less scope to\n\ndo so. A generation ago most African debt was owed to Western governments or multinational bodies, such as the World Bank and the IMF. While roughly a third of external debt (34%) is still owed to multilateral lenders, 43% is accounted for by private creditors, including the Western financial firms that hold so-called Eurobonds (as debt in foreign currency is known). These have a commercial interest in limiting their losses. China, the largest bilateral creditor, typically grants delays in repayment, rather than permanent debt relief.\n\nThen there is the borrowing that few people will mention at the G2o\u2014domestic debt. African countries\u2019 domestic borrowing has surged, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research group, which last month launched the first comprehensive database of African debt. Its accompanying paper notes that outstanding domestic issuance has\n\n|\n\nIt\u2019s coming home\n\nAfrica\u2019, sovereign borrowing, by category, $bn\n\nWi Treasury bill | Domestic bond \u00ae Multilateral loan Wi International bond \u2018MM China* Other\n\n2010 12 14 6 18 20 22 24\n\n*Excluding Egypt and South Africa *No data after 2021 Source: Kiel Institute, African Debt Database\n\nThe Economist November 22nd 2025\n\nrisen from $15obn in 2010 to nearly $500bn in 2024, more than from any external source. The researchers call this \u201ca major transformation in the composition of sovereign liabilities\u201d (see chart). Around half of total government debt in sub-Saharan Africa is owed to domestic banks, according to the IMF.\n\nIn theory, borrowing in local currency avoids the \u201coriginal sin\u201d of sovereign debt: the risk that your currency depreciates relative to the dollar, making repayment harder. \u201cA well-functioning domestic market can be displayed to build market confidence for a foreign investor,\u201d says Ka Lok Wong, one of the authors of the Kiel Institute paper. That research cites Mauritius, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda as examples where there have been clear signs of market development, including longer-duration maturities.\n\nYet the interest rates on domestic loans are usually three to six percentage points higher than on external concessional loans, points out the African Centre for Economic Transformation (ACET), a thinktank in Ghana. Some African governments that have been shut out of external markets are borrowing domestically at high rates and short maturities. The Kiel Institute paper cites Ghana and Mozambique, both of which have defaulted over the past decade. Kenya, which has one of the highest ratios of debt-service costs to revenues in the world, will tap domestic markets for twothirds of its financing needs in 2025.\n\nThe IMF worries about what will happen to local banks if governments struggle to pay back their domestic loans. Banks in sub-Saharan Africa have more than 20% of their assets in government debt, a higher share than any other region, and roughly double the share in 2010. Banks are also at risk of financial repression, the fund says, if inflation erodes the value of their government holdings. The researchers in Kiel note that while on average African domestic borrowing attracts a positive real interest rate, some loans earn minus 20% a year.\n\nA related concern is if lots of government debt crowds out lending to the private sector. Vera Songwe of the Liquidity and Sustainability Facility, a body founded by the UN to support African borrowers, argues that domestic debt is reducing the private lending needed to generate the economic growth that could lower current debt burdens.\n\nDeeper capital markets would be a boon for Africa. Gregory Smith, author of \u201cWhere Credit is Due\u201d, a book on African debt, points out that domestic borrowing was essential for the rise of Asian countries in the 20th century. But while some countries are showing promise, others are stuck in a pattern of short-term borrowing from their own financial institutions because there is little alternative. & "
