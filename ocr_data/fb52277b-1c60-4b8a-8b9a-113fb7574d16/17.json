Adopt the Blue aims to change this by developing the world\u2019s largest network of underwater sites for ocean conservation. Led by\n\nPADI and Blancpain, the initiative empowers divers worldwide to collect data on coral health, marine species and ocean debris through a new conservation portal that streamlines submissions across citizen science programmes. The goal: to expand marine protection and enable smarter ocean policy. Blancpain, creator of the first true diver\u2019s watch in 1953, has backed marine research and exploration for over two decades through its Blancpain Ocean Commitment.\n\nLearn more about Adopt the Blue and Blancpain\u2019s Ocean Commitment\n\nblancpain-ocean-commitment.com/en/ our-projects/padi-adopt-blue-program\n\n\u00a9 Blancpain Ocean Commitment/Biopixel/Christian Miller Produced by El Studios for Blancpain "
