At Hangzhou Technician Institute, more than 6,000 students aged between 14 and 20 are learning how to operate drones, manufacture rare-earth magnets, and maintain electric vehicles and industrial robots. Every year Shao Weijun, its boss, asks more than 600 Chinese firms to forecast their demand for different skills; their answers alter what courses his institute chooses to run. He says almost all his students leave with good jobs.\n\nChina is in the midst of a big push for more and better practical training. Around 34m young people are studying in China\u2019s vocational-education system. These include teenagers in vocational-track high schools, as well as students in post-secondary colleges that operate in parallel to universities. Yet as in many other countries, China\u2019s vocational classrooms suffer\n\nfrom being seen as a sink for unserious students. Learners and parents often see vocational institutions as underfunded and badly run. In many cases they are correct. The Communist Party has good reasons to want to sort all this out.

The party accepts that China is going to need brilliant scientists and engineers if it is to dominate the technologies of the future. But it also recognises that it will need a big army of technicians to keep all its robots, data centres and other bits of gleaming kit running. Ensuring a steady supply of these is essential if China is to achieve the lofty objectives of its next fiveyear economic plan.\n\nMaking plans for Nigel In 2022 China\u2019s government revised its law on vocational education, describing practical qualifications as \u201cequally important\u201d as academic ones. In December 2024 the education ministry announced it was creating 40 new vocational courses for learners at various levels, many relating to whizzy industries such as AI and biomedicine. And in June this year the government launched a campaign to improve the skills of 30m more workers by 2027, particularly those \u201curgently needed for industrial development\u201d in fields such as deep-sea technology and the \u201clow-altitude economy\u201d (drones, flying taxis and the like).\n\nThis latest campaign will notably include efforts to send some university graduates back to college, in the hope that they \u00bb "
