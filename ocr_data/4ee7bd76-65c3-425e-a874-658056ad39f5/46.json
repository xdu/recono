To keep his audience rapt, he has thrown ever more balls into the air. Custom chips? Of course. E-commerce? Why not. Business consulting? Too easy. A consumer device? You betcha.\n\nAt the same time, Mr Altman must keep a hand free to hold out his cap, for the show gets more expensive by the day. Leaked figures indicate that OpenAI expects to burn through $17bn of cash in 2026, up from $9bn in 2025, and that its losses will continue piling up in each of the subsequent three years (see chart 1 on next page). It has already raised over $60bn from investors, more than any private company ever, nearly all of it since late 2022 when ChatGPT shot the previously obscure AI lab to prominence (see chart 2).\n\nMr Altman\u2019s hunger for cash is far from\n\nsated. In 2026 OpenaI will \u201calmost certainly\u201d raise another slug of capital, says a source close to the company. It is reportedly looking for as much as $100bn, at a valuation of perhaps $830bn, up from $soobn in its latest fundraising round in October. Amazon is separately in talks to invest up to $1iobn in the model-maker, which has untangled itself from an exclusive relationship with Microsoft, Amazon\u2019s biggest rival in cloud computing.

Although he has poured cold water on the idea at various points, Mr Altman is also rumoured to be mulling a public offering.\n\nOpenal\u2019s unprecedented fundraising has fuelled unparalleled growth. In 2023 its revenue passed $1bn. In 2025 it reportedly hit $13bn, rising to an annualised rate of $20bn by the year\u2019s end. It took Google and Facebook five and six years, respectively, to pull off the same feat.\n\nThe trouble is that Openal\u2019s demand for computing power\u2014by far its biggest cost\u2014has remained tightly coupled to revenue. The company\u2019s computing needs grew from 200 megawatts in 2023 to 19 gigawatts (GW) in 2025. It has signed letters of intent to add a further 30GW of capacity over the coming years at a cost of around $1.4trn. For now, investors are enthralled by Mr Altman\u2019s dazzling feat. Eventually, however, he will have to prove that he can turn a profit.\n\nMr Altman continues to argue that OpenAl\u2019s economics will improve as the company grows and the upfront cost of training its models dwindles by comparison. Yet training costs keep mounting as OpenaAl contends with stiff competition from rival model-makers. According to\n\nbenchmarks collated by the Stanford Insti\u00bb\u00bb "
