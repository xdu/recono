  "text": "The Economist January 3rd 2026\n\ntute for Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence, the gap in performance among the most advanced models has narrowed significantly over the past year. Lately the biggest threat to OpenalI has been Google, whose Gemini 3 model, released in November, outperformed Openal\u2019s GPT-5.1 on various measures. OpenAl counterpunched with GPT-s.2, but it was far from a knockout blow. Meanwhile, so-called open models, whose numerical parameters (known as \u201cweights\u201d) are freely available, have also been closing the gap in performance with closed models.\n\nOpenal cannot afford to fall behind in model-making. Already there are signs that ChatGPT is losing momentum. According to Sensor Tower, which monitors web traffic, it had 910m monthly active users as of mid-December, compared with Gemini\u2019s 345m. But Gemini is gaining ground. A recent study of big European countries by Deutsche Bank found that consumer subscriptions to OpenAl\u2019s chatbot \u201cground to a halt\u201d in the summer and have since barely grown. Recognising the challenge, Mr Altman instituted a temporary \u201ccode red\u201d at the start of December, telling staff to pause other initiatives and prioritise improving ChatGPT.\n\nMore troubling still are reports that OpenaAl is losing money simply by running its models, which many consumers access through the free version of ChatGpT. In November Ed Zitron, a commentator known for his AI scepticism, published leaked Microsoft figures showing that Openatl\u2019s so-called inference costs exceeded its revenue in the first half of 2025. To cut its losses, the company could raise prices or curb access, but that would run the risk of dragging down growth, particularly with competitors nipping at its heels.\n\nHigh-wire act\n\nAll this helps to explain Openal\u2019s ever expanding focus. Part of the strategy is to develop new routes to monetise its technology. Although Mr Altman reportedly paused work on an initiative to integrate\n\nFeel the burn OpenAl\n\nFree cashflow, $bn\n\n40\n\n2024 25 26 27 28 29 30 Sources: PitchBook; press reports\n\nadvertising into ChatGPT as part of his \u201ccode red\u201d, insiders say the company still has plans to do so in 2026. Already OpenAl allows companies including Etsy, an online marketplace, and Walmart, a retail colossus, to sell their products in America through its chatbot in return for a fee.\n\nOpenAl is also hoping to expand its revenue from enterprise customers, which tend to be stickier. There its main competitor is Anthropic, a rival model-maker whose Claude chatbot has become popular among coders in particular. To catch up, Openat has built a consulting division that helps big companies deploy its technology, and has developed enterprise tools such as AgentKit, launched in October, which clients can use to automate work. Although consumers still provide the majority of Openal\u2019s revenue, the share from businesses has been rising.\n\nOpenal\u2019s strategy also seems to entail vertical integration, drawing inspiration from Google. The search giant\u2019s custom chips, which it began developing more than a decade ago, have become a big advantage in the AI race, costing it between a half and a tenth as much as an equivalent Nvidia chip. The 4bn users of Android devices worldwide also provide a vast distribution channel for Google\u2019s AI products. Over the past year Openal has signed a deal with Broadcom, a chip designer, to develop its own custom silicon, and hired Sir Jony Ive, the designer behind Apple\u2019s iPhone, to dream up a consumer device.\n\nThe difference is that Openal does not have the fistfuls of cash provided by Google\u2019s search engine. Already some investors are growing wary. The boss of one venture-capital (vc) firm notes that Openat\u2019s losses are as big as the deficits of many national governments. He laments that, in fundraising discussions, \u201cyou are not even allowed to ask\u201d about the amount of cash it is burning. When questioned in a recent podcast interview by Brad Gerstner, one of Openal\u2019s most loyal investors, how the company would fund its gargantuan spending commitments, which are equiva-\n\nCumulative capital raised, $bn [2] 80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n2019 20 21 22 23 24 \u00ab25\n\nBusiness 47\n\nlent to roughly 100 times its revenue in 2025, Mr Altman snapped: \u201cIf you want to sell your shares, I\u2019ll find you a buyer.\u201d\n\nOpenal\u2019s detractors decry what they see as Mr Altman\u2019s hubris. \u201cThis is the WeWork story on steroids,\u201d says another VC boss who backs one of its rivals, referring to the once high-flying office-rental business that collapsed spectacularly under the weight of enormous debts and unrealistic growth projections.\n\nIf OpenAl\u2019s enterprise sales disappoint and it is unable to monetise ChatGPT in other ways, the company could quickly unravel. For now, however, Mr Altman still has plenty of believers. \u201cIf you\u2019d told me five years ago that Sam was going to pull these deals off, I would never have believed you. He\u2019s better than anyone realised,\u201d says one of his investors. The year ahead will test whether OpenAl\u2019s boss is more than just a showman. @\n\nWind power in Europe\n\nBlown about\n\nChina\u2019s turbine-makers are coming\n\nUROPE IS BETTING big on wind. To Feu its greenhouse-gas emissions, the EU has committed to roughly double its installed wind-power capacity by 2030, to 425 gigawatts (GW). Britain\u2019s 50GW target for offshore-wind capacity by the same year requires a quadrupling. You might think the continent\u2019s manufacturers would be rubbing their hands in anticipation. Instead, they are nervous.\n\nOver the past two decades Europe\u2019s solar-panel producers have been decimated by cheap imports. But its wind-turbine manufacturers are still mighty. The three biggest\u2014Vestas, Siemens Gamesa and Nordex\u2014each have a larger installed base outside China than any other company, including America\u2019s GE Vernova, according to BloombergNEF, a research group (see chart 1 on next page).\n\nBut it has been a difficult few years for the trio. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 cut the supply of steel, an important input, and pushed up its price, clobbering profits. Manufacturing blunders inflicted further pain. Higher interest rates and, in America, the president\u2019s animus have led developers to scrap a number of big offshore wind projects and cancel orders. Germany\u2019s latest round of offshore-wind auctions failed for lack of bidders.
