  "text": "60 1843 Pro-natalism\n\nwhich he used to attack less observant Mormons (he was part of the DezNat movement, an ultra-conservative and nationalist group of fundamentalist Mormons). After being put on a list of internet extremists by the German intelligence services in 2021, he says he was doxxed by Mormon activists and fired from his job as a defence contractor at Booz Allen Hamilton.\n\nDolan\u2019s de-platforming \u201cwas actually one of the best things that ever happened to me\u201d, he told me, because it led to the soul-searching that eventually sparked NatalCon. Soon after he lost his job he founded EXIT group, a men\u2019s rights organisation, which describes itself as a \u201cfraternity of like-minded men who take a short position in the present system and build for what comes next\u201d (it offers fitness training, coaching on how to create a startup and \u201cone-on-one matchmaking\u201d to connect with an \u201con-side brain trust\u201d of other members).\n\nDolan\u2019s interest in pro-natalism really kicked off after he and his friends watched \u201cThe End of Men\u201d, a documentary from 2022 created by Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News host and current MAGA cheerleader. The film argues that endocrine disruptors are destroying male testosterone, creating a weak and pliant society that is ultimately doomed. It opens with a wellknown conspiracy theorist and vaccine sceptic claiming that \u201cthere has been a 50% decline in sperm counts in the last 40 years along with a precipitous decline in testosterone production.\u201d That fringe thinker, Robert F. Kennedy junior, is now health secretary. \u201cWe're headed for a calamity,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s not hyperbole. That\u2019s not an exaggeration. That\u2019s a mathematical fact.\u201d (It isn\u2019t.)\n\nDolan was shocked that population decline wasn\u2019t a more mainstream concern. He noted that since his doxxing, he\u2019s developed relationships with a number of people featured in the film. \u201cWhat if I just got these really smart people together and we try to really hash this problem out from all angles?\u201d he told me. When I asked him why NatalCon\u2019s speaker roster involves some controversial thinkers, he attributed their presence to a similar thought process: \u201cThat\u2019s an artefact of it being mostly my friends.\u201d Didn\u2019t he think he might need new friends? \u201cWell, erm, maybe,\u201d he said, before catching himself. \u201cBut not at the expense of my existing friends\u2014I like them all.\u201d\n\npowerful political idea\u2014but they have yet to see\n\nthe birth of many serious policies. Trump\u2019s proposals to expand fertility care are just getting off the ground (in any case, it seems as if they will fall short of his campaign promise to make IVF treatment free). Vance has thrown other ideas around, like boosting the child tax credit from $2,000 to $5,000 per child and suggesting that parents should get more votes in elections than non-parents. Sean Duffy, the transport secretary, has said he will prioritise investment in places with higher birth rates. A more modest proposal is to award a \u201cmotherhood medal\u201d to women with more than six children.\n\nFor Stone, the conservative demographer, it was still too early to expect pro-natalists to have coalesced around a core set of policy ideas. \u201cSorry to be an academic about this,\u201d he said when we spoke, waving his hand at the NatalCon attendees milling behind us, \u201cbut I would describe this as a discursive space.\u201d Paul Constance, who characterised himself as \u201cthe only\n\nArve pro-natalists have managed to gestate a\n\n\u201cWHEN ELON MUSK TALKS ABOUT FALLING BIRTH RATES AS THE END OF CIVILISATION AS WE KNOW IT, IT\u2019S WORTH ASKING WHAT HE MEANS BY \u201c*CIVILISATION\u2122\n\nThe Economist November 8th 2025\n\nprogressive\u201d at the conference, agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of theatre and a lot of visionary talk about recovering our civilisation,\u201d he told me, after taking me aside so that we could talk privately. \u201cBut show me Republican policymakers who have an aggressive or ambitious agenda to make it easier for people to have kids.\u201d\n\nThat fact that the American right has yet to agree on workable pro-natal policies should give progressives an opportunity to offer their own ideas. After all, many left-wing staples, such as universal health care and subsidised child care, could be cast as ways to encourage people to have more children. So far, though, progressives have ceded pro-natalism to the right. That\u2019s partly owing to the stigma associated with it. \u201cIt has become so toxic,\u201d said an anthropologist I met at NatalCon. \"I\u2019m worried being here is tantamount to [endorsing] eugenics and scientific racism.\u201d But it also seems that many either don\u2019t see falling fertility as a problem, or don\u2019t believe governments could do much about it if they tried. They are probably right to think so: for many people, the decision to have children is ultimately guided by emotion.\n\nOn the second day of NatalCon I met Saba, an Ethiopian woman dressed in a chic pin-striped suit. As the only black woman there, she had been swarmed all day by curious attendees and journalists. \u201cEveryone has been super welcoming,\u201d she told me, when I finally got a moment with her. \u201cI guess I did get a few jokes about whether I\u2019m a journalist or not. But hey, maybe they were asking everyone.\u201d I can confirm they were not. People loved chatting to me\u2014a blue-eyed white man\u2014uwntil they found out I was a journalist.\n\nSaba has a high-powered finance job in Hong Kong, and used to work in New York and London. Some people at the conference would undoubtedly consider her a member of the metropolitan global elite; certainly her lifestyle was a world away from that of Tim Adkinson, the truck driver I sat with at the opening dinner. Yet she was also wearing a yellow wristband indicating that she was single. \u201cWe\u2019re all facing this challenge in cities like New York or Hong Kong, where it is especially difficult with dating.\u201d It was hard, she admitted, having had such a mobile career. \u201cNo regrets, but there are trade-offs.\u201d\n\nLike Adkinson, she was also now in her early 30s and single, without the family she had expected to have by this point. \u201cI\u2019m here because I need to really start thinking about this. If I want to have a large family, I can\u2019t do that when I\u2019m 37,\u201d she told me. She knew the conference wasn\u2019t her natural scene, but she wanted to form her own opinion of the people and ideas involved\u2014to understand why she and her friends were having such a hard time dating. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea that if I bring this up with my progressive friends there\u2019s immediately this sense that what\u2019s being asked is that we chain women to the stove and prevent them from working,\u201d she said. She thought the conference was in fact attempting to get ahead of the problem\u2014 before the dystopian alternatives became the only options on the table.\n\nSaba hadn\u2019t met someone who had swept her off her feet yet, but she said she\u2019d had some interesting conversations. As I turned to adjust my recorder, another suitor sidled up to her. I moved away\u2014there was plenty for them to talk about. @\n\nBarclay Bram is a senior podcast producer at The Economist.
