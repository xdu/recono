  "text": "58 1843 Pro-natalism\n\nStone assured me that pro-natalism was consistent with protecting women\u2019s rights, especially their right to have the families they want. At the same time, he said, his voice sincere, \u201cA lot of the women who are highly pro-natal are also more interested in their role as mothers than in their role as conference attendees.\u201d (He said his own wife fell into this camp and had chosen to stay at home with their children.)\n\nThe few women who did have a platform at NatalCon were either \u201ctrad wives\u2019\u2014the term for women who voluntarily embrace old-fashioned gender roles\u2014 or tech-world girlbosses, who were keen to show how deftly they were combining their large families with their jobs. One such career woman was Simone Collins, the former managing director of Dialog, a secretive members-only organisation co-founded by Peter Thiel. She took to the conference stage wearing a milkmaid\u2019s bonnet\u2014a sly nod to her detractors\u2019 \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d jibes\u2014with a baby strapped to her back. It was her fourth child, a girl named Industry Americus (her two daughters have gender-neutral names). At the time, Simone was expecting her fifth baby. \u201cHalf of me wants to vomit and the other half wants to lie down on the stage,\u201d she told the audience (she made it through her speech without incident, to rapturous applause).\n\nSimone and her husband Malcolm are two of the most visible tech pro-natalists in America. Both in their late-30s, they wear thick black-rimmed glasses (Simone\u2019s are round, Malcolm\u2019s square). Together, they lobby investors and developers who they believe can engineer solutions to America\u2019s falling birth rate. They also run the Collins Institute for the Gifted (which offers Al-led homeschooling), write books and host a podcast, and have invested in fertility-tech companies and a dating app for long-term partnerships between people who want children.\n\nThey were spurred to take up pro-natalism around a decade ago, when Malcolm was the director of strategy for a venture-capital fund in South Korea. His boss had asked him to model what the country would look like over the next five to ten decades\u2014\u201cyou know, what will be the big industries. Basic vc stuff\u201d Malcolm remembers being struck by the country\u2019s low birth rate. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like Korea has an economy in a hundred years,\u201d Malcolm told his boss, who he says shrugged it off. \u201cThat horrified me,\u201d he said. It was too late to save South Korea, in his view\u2014but he could do something for America.\n\nTo garner attention for their cause, \u201cpeople needed to hate us to have a reason to talk about us. So we kept doing things that we called media-baiting,\u201d Malcolm said. The more controversy they caused, he reasoned, the more likely people would be forced to learn about falling birth rates and pro-natalist ideas.\n\nThat\u2019s why he shrugged when I mentioned a Guardian profile of the couple, which revealed that he had slapped one of his children in front of the journalist. When the piece was published last year, it instantly went viral, causing people online to remark on the Collinses\u2019 seeming dislike of their own children. \u201cWhen you protect a person from any negative emotional stimulus, they'll quickly spiral into anxiety and depression whenever they encounter difficulties in the real world,\u201d Malcolm told me, by way of explanation for his actions.\n\nI had wondered whether pro-natalism was more attractive to people in the tech industry, than to, say, other educated groups in America, because they are\n\n\u201cHAVING A CHILD IS MORE LIKE JOINING THE MILITARY THAN GOING OUT TO DINNER\u201d\n\nThe Economist November 8th 2025\n\nsome of the few people who feel they can comfortably afford to have massive families. But it was clear that, even for a couple as affluent as the Collinses, some sacrifice was necessary to raise their brood. Rather than living in an urban tech hub, for instance, they had moved to rural Pennsylvania, where it was cheaper to buy a house large enough for a host of kids.\n\nAs Malcolm and I spoke, I noticed that the Collins children were wearing the same black polo shirt as their father. \u201cMostly we just have one outfit for the kids that can change with age,\u201d he explained. I noted that that seemed like a pragmatic way to raise children. \u201cWe're breeding at scale,\u201d he responded matter-offactly, \u201cso we need to find ways to be frugal.\u201d\n\nformations in Silicon Valley over the past few\n\nyears, as the tech industry\u2019s most prominent chief executives have become more visibly entwined with the Trump administration and the wider MAGA movement. Malcolm Collins told me that he didn\u2019t find it difficult to move in the same world as the religious conservatives in Trump\u2019s base: \u201cIt\u2019s not a messy alliance. We\u2019re not taking jabs at each other regularly. We all know each other.\u201d\n\nIn both camps there was a sense that they had been fighting against the tide of mainstream liberal culture\u2014what Musk has often referred to as \u201cthe woke mind virus\u201d\u2014and that they, with their heterodox views, were the true champions of diversity. \u201cA big part of why the tech and MAGA alliance works so well is because we both are just like, hey, leave us alone. Stop imposing your values on us and stop trying to get our kids to adopt your values.\u201d\n\nT: Collinses\u2019 path into pro-natalism tracks trans"
