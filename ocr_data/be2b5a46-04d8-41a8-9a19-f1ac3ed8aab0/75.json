Will the strategy work?\n\nW 7 HEN HE CO-FOUNDED Airbnb in\n\n2007, the 26-year-old Brian Chesky was a bright-eyed design-school graduate who wore blue jeans and nondescript Tshirts. The 44-year-old tech boss who greets The Economist dressed in head-totoe black cuts a rather different figure.\n\nLike its chief executive, Airbnb has also changed with age. The booking platform, which boasts more than 8m listings across nearly every country, is \u201cnow a grown-up company\u2019, insists Mr Chesky. Gone are the days of burning through cash in a rush to scale. Airbnb\u2019s operating margin in the second quarter was a handsome 21%. In August it announced that it would repurchase $6bn-worth of shares. Its market value, at $78bn, exceeds that of Marriott, the world\u2019s largest hotelier.\n\nYet investors worry that maturity has brought stagnation. Although the $86bnworth of bookings made through the platform in the 12 months to June represented a 10% increase on the same period a year\n\nbefore, its rate of growth has been falling (see chart 1 on next page). Analysts expected more signs of a slowdown when the firm reported its quarterly earnings on November 6th, after The Economist went to press. Airbnb\u2019s shares are down by 11% over the past year. To rekindle growth, it is looking to new markets, new product lines and new technology. Will the plan work? Airbnb began with Mr Chesky and two friends renting out an airbed in their living room in San Francisco.

In 2016 it established a marketplace for \u201cexperiences\u201d, such as walking tours, as well as a guidebook. In 2019 it set up a film studio. Costs ballooned by 45% that year, even as revenue growth began slowing.\n\n\u201cIt became chaos,\u201d reflects Mr Chesky. \u201cI had no idea what I was doing.\u201d The lessons he took from that period\u2014including the need to keep control of decisions, be steeped in the details and have as few employees as possible\u2014have shaped Mr Chesky\u2019s leadership style ever since. (Paul Graham, a renowned startup investor, would later use Mr Chesky\u2019s approach to illustrate what he termed \u201cfounder mode\u201d.)\n\nThen came the covid-19 pandemic. As bookings ground to a halt, Mr Chesky saw an opportunity to rebuild the company. He fired a quarter of its staff, merged divisions, removed management layers and paused the expansion into experiences. Despite lockdowns, Airbnb\u2019s stockmarket debut in December 2020 was a hit, with its shares more than doubling on the day. When travel resumed, the company roared back to growth as it set about fixing users\u2019 various gripes, including a lack of transpa-\n\nrency in fees, too many poor-quality list>> "
