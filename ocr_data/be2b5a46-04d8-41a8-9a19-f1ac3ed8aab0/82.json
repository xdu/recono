The scheme had an unambiguous and overwhelmingly positive impact: the kids were more likely to graduate from school and less likely to be arrested or convicted of crime. In 2010 James Heckman, a Nobel-prizewinning economist, and co-authors calculated that, on conservative assumptions, the investment made in the children returned 7-10% a year to society\u2014comparable to the historical rate of return on equity.\n\nSuch results have been the foundation of calls for more early-childhood education across the world. The example set by Perry and similar early-childhood experiments was used as justification for Tony Blair\u2019s Sure Start scheme in Britain. Mr Heckman\u2019s study was the basis of President Barack Obama\u2019s claim, in his 2013 State of the Union address, that society saves $7 for \u201cevery dollar we invest in highquality early-childhood education\u201d. And then there is Quebec.\n\nCanadian nasty\n\nHaving been inspired by the Perry experiment, in 1997 the province set up a publicly funded scheme offering full-time child care for just $5 a day. It was extremely popular. The share of children up to the age of four in care rose by 14 percentage points relative to the rest of Canada, which had immediate labour-market consequences. The share of women in the labour force rose by eight percentage points. Today, the maternal employment rate in Quebec remains, at 87%, one of the world\u2019s highest.\n\nThis shift in Quebec, but not in the rest of Canada, is about as good an experiment in how sucha policy affects children as it is possible to find. To work out its impact, Jonathan Gruber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Michael Baker of the University of Toronto and Kevin Milligan of the University of British Columbia tapped into a wealth of data on children in Quebec collected by the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth, which gathers details on child care, teacher evaluations, test scores and behaviour reports.\n\nThe trio published their first study in 2005, and the results were damning. Shifting to universal child care appeared to lead to a rise in aggression, anxiety and hyperactivity among Quebecer children, as well as a fall in motor and social skills. The effects were large: anxiety rates doubled; roughly a third more kids were reported to be hyperactive. Indeed, the difference in hyperactivity rates was larger than is typically reported between boys and girls.\n\nA decade later, once the children were in high school, the authors followed up. The best that can be said is that the scheme did not have any impact on test scores or cognitive skills. But the children\n\na Wrong path\n\nQuebec, criminal convictions per 100 people relative to the rest of Canada\n\n== Born in 2000 (5 years of exposure to child-care programme)\n\n~~ 1997 (3 years) =~ 1994 (1 year) == Before 1993 (No exposure) EEE eS es 4 -2 -3\n\n12 123 14 15 6 17 18 Age at conviction\n\n19 20\n\nSource: \u201cThe long-run impacts of a universal child-care programme\u2019, by M. Baker et al., American Economic Journal, 2019\n\nreported their life satisfaction to be worse. And a rise in juvenile crime in Quebec, compared with the rest of Canada, implies that they were convicted of a fifth more drug and property crimes.\n\nQuebec had tried, while keeping costs down, to imitate a small pilot on a grand scale. Standards inevitably slipped. When Mr Heckman was asked by the New York Times about the province\u2019s experience, he noted how different it was from the trials he had studied. \u201cThese were warehouses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were fairly impersonal, there wasn\u2019t any real quality. Quality has to be a sine qua non of the whole enterprise.\u201d\n\nThink of the Perry and Quebec experiments\u2014two of the most widely cited in the early-education literature\u2014as poles at either end of a spectrum. There are a number of differences between them: targeted versus universal; high quality versus low quality; enrolment from birth versus enrolment from the age of three; a few hours in care versus the whole day. This makes it hard to tease out the impact of any one.\n\nBut the literature on early education is large enough that it is possible to isolate some.

Studies based on lotteries for pre-K systems in Boston and Tulsa have also found a positive impact on highschool-graduation and college-enrolment rates. The trouble is what, if anything, governments should do for middleand highincome kids under three. \u201cUniversal preschool seems like kind of a no-brainer,\u201d says Mr Gruber. \u201cUniversal child care is a lot more controversial.\u201d\n\nThere is one big issue with expanding schemes from pre-school (aged three or so) all the way down to infancy. In their early years, children\u2019s development seems to depend more on the intensity of adult interaction than being around other kids. That is why, even in places such as France, where centre-based care is well regarded and up to 85% of the cost is subsidised, research by Lawrence Berger of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Lidia Panico and Anne Solaz of France\u2019s national demographics institute has echoed some of what was found in Quebec. If enrolled in a creche at the age of one then, by the age of two, children\u2019s behaviour was reported to be much worse than if cared for by an assistante maternelle or their parents.\n\nThe kids aren't alright Aneed for lots of adult interaction implies there are few economies of scale to be found in the care of babies and infants. By school age, an adult can oversee 20 to 30 children. At pre-school, they watch 12 or 15. In the best nurseries a carer looks after two or three. Subsidised centre-based care is of high enough quality in Finland that when a stipend was introduced to pay Finnish mothers to stay home after ten months, child development and female incomes suffered. But to reach such standards the government spends much more than the OECD average. Although New Mexico is funding its generous programme with levies on oil and gas extraction, fiscal room is more limited in New York and other states, which spells trouble. Ultimately, child care is expensive. It is expensive for parents in America, it is expensive for the Finnish government and it is expensive\u2014in the long run\u2014in places that try to do it on the cheap. These costs are paid either via exorbitant sums handed over to day-care centres, forgone career progression, high taxes or by undermining childrens\u2019 development. None is palatable. Yet the worst are the extremes: that mothers should forgo work for years or that families might be incentivised to place babies into an underfunded mode of care ill-suited to their needs. What a pity that those are the solutions American politicians seem most determined to seek. @ "
