  "text": "The Economist December 6th 2025\n\n37\n\nThe long goodbye\n\nTo China\u2019s delight, many talented Chinese no longer feel welcome in America\n\nHINESE-BORN brainiacs have been at\n\nthe forefront of innovation in America. Yang Chen-Ning, a Nobel-prizewinning physicist who died in October, was one such. But a mixture of pushes (such as the hostility of Donald Trump\u2019s administration to all sorts of newcomers) and pulls (including China\u2019s lavish support for science and tech) mean many are now following the path Yang took later in life: he returned to China in his 80s to teach at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Today, a host of Chinese youngsters are also choosing not to go to America to study at all.\n\nThese shifts have been under way since Mr Trump\u2019s first administration and are now striking among three overlapping groups: students, scientists and tech types. They stand to harm both America\u2019s best universities and its most innovative firms. Chinese-born boffins have long made up the largest group of foreign researchers in America. An exodus just now, as the\n\nworld\u2019s two largest economies are locked in bitter trade conflict, will erode one of America\u2019s biggest advantages in its technological rivalry with China: its ability to lure and keep superstars.\n\nNot that the Trump administration appears to see it that way. In May Marco Rubio, America\u2019s secretary of state, said America would \u201caggressively revoke visas for Chinese students\u201d. (Mr Trump later said he wanted 600,000 more of them in a distinctly confusing addition to the debate.) In September a congressional committee released a report titled \u201cFrom PhD to PLA\u201d, calling for tighter restrictions on\n\n38 Quiet fury in Hong Kong 39 Watching a leaked court-martial\n\n\u2014 Chaguan is away\n\nChinese students, citing their possible future links with China\u2019s armed forces. That month Mr Trump proposed a charge of $100,000 on new applications for H1-B visas, which are heavily used by tech companies to bring skilled foreign workers to America. Chinese and Indians will be among the hardest hit.\n\nLook first at the shift among students. The number of Chinese youngsters studying in America grew six-fold between 2000 and 2019, when it peaked at more than 372,000. China accounted for more than a third of all international students in America. Since then their numbers have dropped by nearly 30%. Covid-19 was one reason, but the American government's hostility is another. Studying in America now seems like an expensive bet on Trumpian temperance.\n\nAt the same time the standing of America\u2019s universities has deteriorated in China, says Yingyi Ma, a sociologist at Syracuse University in New York. Ten years ago haigui, the Chinese term for returnees with degrees obtained abroad, were seen as \u201cwinners of the rat race\u201d who would get plum jobs in China. (The daughter of Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, went to Harvard in 2010.) That advantage has diminished. Chinese bosses now think domestic graduates are just as good, if not better, than American-educated ones, says Dr Ma. "
