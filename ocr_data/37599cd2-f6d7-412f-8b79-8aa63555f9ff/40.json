But the flaws of his rule\n\nare beginning to show\n\nTT\" CRACKLE of explosions echoes across the Damascus sky. A year ago such blasts were the soundtrack to rebel forces bearing down on the capital. Today they come from celebratory fireworks. Syrians are preparing for the first anniversary of their liberation from the regime of Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2019s blood-soaked dictator who fled on December 8th 2024. Billboards celebrating their freedom plaster the city. Syrians have travelled to the capital from all over the country in anticipation of the celebrations.\n\nAhmed al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda leader who is now Syria\u2019s interim president, has got plenty right over the past year. He has ended Syria\u2019s decades of diplomatic isolation with startling speed. He is a fixture at conferences around the world. At the White House in November Donald Trump sprayed him with aftershave while inquiring how many wives he had\u2014another moment in his unlikely bro-\n\nmance with the American president.\n\nMany of the sanctions that brought Syria to its knees under Mr Assad have been waived. Congress is expected to repeal the most punishing\u2014the Caesar Act\u2014by early 2026. International firms are exploring deals. In December executives from Chevron, an oil giant, visited Damascus.

The red flag of Baathist Syria has been replaced by the green revolutionary standard. Much of the apparatus of Mr Assad\u2019s hated regime has been dismantled. His feared intelligence services have gone. Hundreds of prisons stand empty. Syrians feel able to criticise their government in public. Syria has not turned into the Islamic caliphate his critics predicted. Women are being recruited into the police. Wine flows freely in the restaurants and bars of the old city of Damascus. This is not Afghanistan under the Taliban.\n\nBut cracks are beginning to appear. The economy has not collapsed, but the financial situation of many Syrians has deteriorated since liberation. Hundreds of thousands of government employees have been fired. Subsidies are being cut. Sanctions relief is yet to produce much. Reconstruction is mostly non-existent.\n\nAnd Mr Sharaa is taking the state in a worrying direction. New bodies such as the General Authority for Borders and Customs and a sovereign-wealth fund have been created by presidential decree, stripping ministries of revenue-raising powers. Run by loyalists, there is no public oversight. \u201cThey have no legal or constitutional basis,\u201d frets a lawyer in Damascus.\n\nMeanwhile, a new General Secretariat for Political Affairs, headed by the foreign \u00bb "
