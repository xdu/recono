In the absence of clearer facts, what happens next may hinge on two questions. The first is whether Mr Hegseth\u2019s execute order was illegal from the outset. The other is how robust the decision-making process and legal safeguards were in the operations room when Admiral Bradley reportedly approved the follow-on strike.\n\nAs is common, Mr Hegseth\u2019s order appears to have delegated authority to carry out the strike through the chain of command to Admiral Bradley, then in charge of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), home of elite, secretive forces such as the army\u2019s Delta Force and the navy\u2019s SEALs. The admiral is well-respected in special-operations circles and had the right background to oversee the mission. \u201cHe is extremely experienced in this type of individual and lethal targeting,\u201d says a former senior judge advocate-general (JAG), the military\u2019s uniformed lawyers. \u201c[He\u2019s] spent most of his professional career doing this in Iraq or Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nFar-flung air and missile strikes are typically carried out from a joint-operations centre, a hub for co-ordinating missions with units in the field, linked by a live-video feed. Mr Hegseth watched the operation live on video, although he claims he did not \u201cstick around\u201d to witness the second strike. In any case, it would be highly unusual for a secretary of defence (now rebranded secretary of war) to intervene once the operation was under way, say officials familiar with the process. Admiral Bradley would also have been flanked by a gaggle of aides specialising in operations, intelligence, munitions and, crucially, a JAG, to advise on whether the strikes were legal.\n\nTypically, commanders will survey the room to get sign-off from a JAG and other officers before launching a strike. Yet JAGs lack formal authority in the chain of command. They do not have a veto, points out Daniel Maurer, a former army lawyer now at Ohio Northern University.\n\nThe room where it happens According to the Post, Admiral Bradley justified the follow-on strike as necessary to remove a potential navigation hazard for other vessels. The Pentagon has fired multiple times on different drug boats to remove them as potential hazards. Yet legal experts argue that is a legally dubious rationalisation in a case where survivors are present. \u201cThe question is which would take priority\u2014removal of the hazard or care for the wounded,\u201d says the former senior JAG. \u201cCare for the wounded is a function of international treaty law.\u201d\n\nA bigger question is whether America\u2019s\n\nentire anti-drug campaign is legally defensible. Although the Trump administration argues it is engaged in an \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug gangs, few legal scholars believe that blowing up drug boats fits that definition. In many ways the campaign is indicative of Mr Hegseth\u2019s broader contempt for the laws of war. Since taking office he has gutted the Pentagon\u2019s Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Office and fired a multitude of senior JAGs.\n\nMr Hegseth often rails against what he claims are restrictive rules of engagement, which \u201ctie the hands\u201d of soldiers in the field. Morale within the JAG Corps is tanking. Many of the new lawyers installed in\n\nHealthcare\n\nConcepts of a plan\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe Economist December 6th 2025\n\nsenior posts over recent months \u201cdon\u2019t care what the right answer is\u201d, bemoans the former senior JAG. \u201cThey spend all their time trying to figure out what the administration wants and then reverse engineer how to get to it.\u201d\n\nThe controversy over the September 2nd strike may provide a service by focusing scrutiny on why the Trump administration is using disproportionate force against criminals in speedboats. Narcogangs are not al-Qaeda or Islamic State. \u201cWhether these boats justify this kind of interdiction is really the question,\u201d says a former JAG who advised JSOC operations. \u201cThat\u2019s the debate we should be having.\u201d\n\nExpiring Obamacare subsidies remain a headache for Republicans\n\nICTURE A REPUBLICAN voter. Perhaps Pies are in Texas or Florida, a farmer or someone running their own small company. These people are more likely to get their health insurance with supercharged subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces. The boosted tax credits are set to expire at the end of December, probably causing 3.5m people to become uninsured by 2027, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan scorekeeper. But despite the fact that many of their voters rely on them, Republicans, in Congress and in the White House, have yet to decide on a solution, or even if this is a problem.\n\nThe question over what to do about the\n\nenhanced subsidies was behind the latest government shutdown. Though the government reopened, Republicans are still stuck. The Senate is to vote as soon as next week on the future of the boosted subsidies, but what it is voting on is still unclear. Mike Johnson, the House speaker, is not guaranteeing a vote at all. Avoiding the debate might not be an option for much longer: as the deadline gets closer, the proposals are becoming even more radical. What to do about the enhanced subsidies has become a microcosm of divisions in the Republican coalition, reaching into debates on affordability, concerns about the deficit and even abortion.\n\nSince the covid-era introduction of the \u00bb\n\n"
