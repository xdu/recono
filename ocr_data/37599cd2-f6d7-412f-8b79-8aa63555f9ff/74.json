Why?\n\nA: DAWN PALMYRA\u2019S magnificent columns and buildings glow gold against the sky. The oasis city (pictured), built on an ancient trading route, was once one of Syria\u2019s most popular tourist sites, attracting an estimated 150,000 visitors annually. After the outbreak of civil war in 2011, that number plummeted as rebels and Islamist groups fought Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces for control. Palmyra was closed to international visitors: only the Russian and Iranian soldiers who came to prop up Syria\u2019s despot were allowed in.\n\nMr Assad\u2019s odious regime fell a year ago, on December 8th 2024, and tourists are slowly returning to Syria. Some come to marvel at what remains of the splendid temples, theatres and tombs. (Jihadists blew up monuments they deemed idolatrous, including the Temple of Bel, which\n\nwas consecrated nearly 2,000 years ago.) A few visitors, however, seek more gruesome thrills. They want to see Syria\u2019s scars, to stand on the ground where battles, bombings and atrocities took place. They are known as \u201cdark tourists\u201d.\n\nThey swap tips on Instagram and TikTok.

Some hope to visit Saidnaya: the country\u2019s most notorious prison, on the outskirts of Damascus, is known as the \u201cHuman Slaughterhouse\u201d. Rebels took possession of it after Mr Assad fled from his country; the prison is now empty and locked. But enterprising tour guides promise they can get curious travellers inside.\n\nAmong those guides is Rita Badran, a dentistry student, who advertises her services to more than 25,000 followers on Instagram. A private tour of Syria costs $130 per person; to visit Saidnaya, she charges a $100 \u201cpermit fee\u201d (she knows some of the guards). She has taken visitors\u2014who are mainly from America and Europe\u2014to see the aircraft that the Assad regime used to drop barrel bombs on civilians, and to explore the tunnels dug under Damascus by rebels. \u201cThere are hundreds or thousands of people still buried here that they couldn\u2019t retrieve,\u201d she says, walking through the blasted landscape.\n\nDark tourism is big business. Global Industry Analysts, a market-research firm, estimates that the dark-tourism market is worth $35bn and will grow to $4ibn by 2030.
