  "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nONE Al DOES NOT FIT ALL: WHY BUSINESS-CRITICAL FUNCTIONS CANT RELY ON GENERIC AGENTIC Al TOOLS\n\nThere\u2019s a common misconception that one Al system Can support every team in a business. But the truth is, not all work is the same. Some functions are routine and can use general Al tools. Others are critical, highstakes, and deeply tied to the company\u2019s financial and operational health. These functions cannot depend on generic Al tools. Procurement and supply chain are among the clearest examples.\n\nProcurement deals with contracts, suppliers, pricing, risks, and compliance. Supply chain deals with continuity, logistics, inventory, disruptions, and service levels. A single wrong decision in these areas can affect costs, timelines, relationships, and even the organization\u2019s reputation. Generic agentic Al tools are not built for this kind of complexity. They may process information, but they do not understand the rules, patterns, or consequences that professionals in these functions manage every day.\n\nWhy Generic Al Falls Short\n\nProcurement and supply chain work requires structured\n\nthinking, due diligence, and policy awareness. For example, Al must know when to run supplier checks, when to flag risky contract terms, when a spend threshold triggers approval, or when a shipment delay impacts production. A general-purpose agent has\n\nno training in these areas. It does not recognize the difference between a basic request and a high-risk one. It lacks the judgment needed to act safely.\n\nFor agentic Al to support procurement effectively, it must be built with purpose and trained on the realities of the function. It needs four things.\n\n1. Procurement and supply chain knowledge: Category knowledge, supplier records, contract templates, risk scores, policies, and historical decisions give the agent real context.\n\nGEP\u00ae delivers agentic Al-powered procurement and supply chain solutions that help global enterprises become more agile and resilient, operate more efficiently and\n\n2. Decision logic shaped by the function: Procurement and supply chain run on rules that guide approvals, escalations, checks, and compliance steps. The agent must learn and apply this logic consistently.\n\n3. Guardrails that prevent risk: Actions must follow policies, budget limits, legal requirements, and audit needs. Guardrails protect the organization.\n\n4. Full workflow awareness: Intake, sourcing, contracting, supplier management, logistics, and risk monitoring all connect. The agentic Al system must understand the entire flow to act responsibly.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCritical functions cannot rely on off-the-shelf agentic Al. They need tools that understand their data, decisions, risks, and workflows. Only domain-trained agentic Al can act with the care, accuracy, and accountability these functions demand. m=\n\nGEP\u2019s Agentic Al: Purpose-Built for Procurement & Supply Chain Teams\n\nGEP\u2019s agentic Al is purpose-built for procurement and supply chain teams.
